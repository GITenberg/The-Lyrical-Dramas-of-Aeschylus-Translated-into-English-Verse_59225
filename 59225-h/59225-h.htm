TRANSCRIBER&rsquo;S NOTES
</h2>

<p>
The original text included Greek characters that were not supported by
Unicode at the time of this ebook&rsquo;s creation. In these cases I used the
nearest available character and surrounded it with parentheses. A full
listing, along with descriptions of the proper characters, can be found
at the end of the book in the section titled <a href="#gr_notes">Greek Textual Notes</a>.
</p>

<p>
Footnotes have been relocated to the end of the book. Footnotes and
(end)notes are labeled with an &ldquo;f&rdquo; and &ldquo;n&rdquo;, respectively.
</p>

<p>
Text alterations: some spelling and punctuation corrections, change some of the plays&rsquo;
formatting, and remove obsolete references to &ldquo;vol. I&rdquo; and &ldquo;vol. II&rdquo;,
which were leftover from the 1850 two-volume version of this work.

EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">Professor John Stuart Blackie</span> [1809-1895], in his day fondly called
&ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s greatest Greek scholar,&rdquo; began his translation of Æschylus
when he was still comparatively a young man, in 1837-8, and he did not
complete it, working intermittently, until 1846. Even then, there was a
process of revision and correction to be gone through, which carried on
the work by a further term of three or four years.
</p>

<p>
The translation had occupied twelve years, says Miss Stoddart, in her
biography (1895), but only the first three and the last three of those
years were specially devoted to the work. Carlyle interested himself in
finding a London publisher for the translation, and he
characteristically mingled his praise of it with blame. He spoke of it
indeed as &ldquo;spirited and lively to a high degree,&rdquo; and added, &ldquo;the
grimmer my protest against your having gone into song at all with the
business.&rdquo; It was Professor Aytoun who suggested the rhymed choruses.
Leigh Hunt wrote to Blackie, approving where Carlyle had demurred. He
said: &ldquo;Your version is right masculine and Æschylean, strong, musical,
conscious of the atmosphere of mystery and terror which it breathes in;&rdquo;
and he especially admired the poetic interpretation given &ldquo;to the
lyrical nature of these fine Cassandra-voiced ringing old dramas.&rdquo;
</p>
<br/>
<p>
The following is a list of the chief English translators of Æschylus:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Tragedies translated into English Verse; R. Potter, 1777, 1779.
</p>

<p>
The Seven Tragedies literally translated into English Prose, from the
Text of Blomfield and Schütz, 1822, 1827.
</p>

<p>
Literal translation by T. A. Buckley, 1849.
</p>

<p>
The Lyrical Dramas . . . into English Verse, J. S. Blackie, 1850; into
English Prose, F. A. Paley, 1864, 1891; E. H. Plumptre, 1868, 1873; Anna
Swanwick, 1873; from a revised text, W. Headlam, 1900, etc.
</p>

<p>
The Seven Plays in English Verse; L. Campbell, 1890.
</p>

<p>
The Agamemnon was translated by Dean Milman, 1865; and &ldquo;transcribed&rdquo;
by Robert Browning, 1877. A. W. Verrall&rsquo;s edition of the text, with
commentary and translation, appeared in 1889.
</p>

<p>
The most important of the earlier editions of the text was that by
Stanley; of the more recent, that by Schütz, Wellauer, and Hermann.

PREFACE
</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum">{1}</span></p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">The</span> poet who publishes an original work, or the painter who exhibits the
product of his own brush, does well, in the general case, to spare
himself the trouble of any sort of introductory exposition or
explanation; for the public are apt to look upon all such preambles as a
sort of forestalling of their own critical rights: besides that a good
work of art contains within itself all that is necessary to unfold its
own story to an intelligent spectator. A translator, however, is
differently situated. In interposing himself between the original author
and the public, he occupies the position of an optical artist, who, when
he presents to the infirm human eye the instrument that is to enable it
to scan the path of the stars, is bound, not merely to guarantee the
beauty, but to explain to the intelligent spectator the principle, and
to make intelligible the reality of the spectacle. Or, as all similes
limp, we may say that a translator stands to the public in the position
of the old Colchian sorceress, who having cut a live body in pieces, and
submitted it to a new fermentation in a magic pot, engaged to produce it
again re-invigorated in all its completeness. The spectators of such a
process have a right to know, not only that something&mdash;it may be a very
beautiful and a very attractive thing&mdash;has come out of the cauldron, but
also that the identical thing put in has come out without transmutation
or transformation. And if there has been transmutation or transformation
to any extent, they are entitled to know how far.
</p>

<p>
Now, with regard to poetical translation, I honestly confess that I
consider the reproduction, according to the German idea of a <span class="sc">facsimile</span>
in all respects corresponding to the original, an impossible problem. In
the alembic of the translator&rsquo;s mind it is not merely that the original
elements of the organic whole, being disintegrated, are to be restored,
but the elements out of which the restoration is to be made, are
altogether different; as if a man should be required to make a
counterpart to a silk vesture with cotton twist, or to copy a glowing
Venus of Titian in chalk. The reproduction, in such a case, can never be
perfect; the copy may be something like&mdash;very like&mdash;the original, but it
is not the same; it may be better in some points, and in some points
worse. Just so in language. It is impossible sometimes to translate from
one language into another. <span class="pagenum">{2}</span> Greek, for instance, is a language so
redundant with rich efflorescence, so tumid with luxuriant growth and
overgrowth of all kinds, that our temperate language, unless it allow
itself to run into sheer madness, must often refuse to follow it. Like a
practised posture-maker or expert ballet-dancer, the old Hellenic
dialect can caper gracefully through movements that, if attempted, would
twist our English tongue into distortion or dislocation. Æschylus, in
particular, was famous, even amongst the Greeks, for the fearless,
masculine licence with which he handled the most flexible of all
languages. This licence I profess to follow only where I can do so
intelligibly and gracefully. The reader must not expect to find, in the
guise of the English language, an image of Æschylus in every minute
verbal feature, such as its gigantic outline has been sketched by
Aristophanes.
</p>

<p>
Some men of literary note, in the present day, observing the great
difficulties with which poetical translators have to contend, especially
when using a language of inferior compass, have been of opinion that the
task ought not to be attempted at all&mdash;that all poetical translations,
from Greek at least into English, should be done in prose; and, in
confirmation of this opinion, they point to the English translation of
the Hebrew Bible as a model. But if, as Southey says, &ldquo;a translation is
good precisely as it faithfully represents the matter, manner, and
spirit of the original,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#f_p_01b" id="f_p_01a">1</a></sup> it is difficult to see how this
doctrine can be entertained. Poetry is distinguished from prose more by
the manner than by the matter; and rhythmical regularity or verse is
precisely that quality which distinguishes the manner of poetry from
that of prose. In one sense, and in the best sense, Plato and Richter
and Jeremy Taylor are poets; in another sense, and in the best sense,
Æschylus and Dante and Shakespere are philosophers; but that which a
poet as a poet has, and a philosopher as a philosopher has not, is
verse; and this element the advocates of a prose translation of poetical
works are content to miss out! That the argument from the English
translation of the Bible is not applicable to every case, will appear
plain to any one who will figure to himself Robert Burns or Horace or
Beranger in a prose dress. In the Bible we seek for the simplicity of
religious inculcation or devout meditation, and would consider the
finest rhythmical decorations out of place. Besides, the style of the
Hebrew poetry is eminently simple; and the rhythmical element of
language, so far as I can learn, was never highly cultivated by the
Jews, whose mission on earth was of a different kind. The Greeks, on the
other hand, were eminently a poetical people; the poetry of their drama,
though not without its <span class="pagenum">{3}</span> own simplicity, is, in respect of mere
linguistic organism, of a highly decorated order; and by nothing is that
decoration so marked as by a systematic attention to rhythm. I consider,
therefore, that prose translations of the Greek dramatists will never
satisfy the just demands of a cultivated taste, for the plain reason
that they omit that element which is most characteristic of the manner
of the original.
</p>

<p>
I am persuaded that the demand for prose translations of poets had
arisen, in this country, more from a sort of desperate reaction against
certain vicious principles of the old English school of translation,
than from a serious consideration either of the nature of the thing, or
of the capacity of our noble language. In Germany, I do not find that
this notion has ever been entertained; plainly because the German
poetical translations did not err, like our English ones, in conspiring,
by every sort of fine flourishing and delicate furbishment, to obscure
or to blot out what was most characteristic in their originals. The
proper problem of an English translator is not <i>how to say a thing as
the author would have said it, had he been an Englishman</i>; but <i>how,
through the medium of the English language, to make the English reader
feel both what he said and how he said it, being a Greek</i>. Now, any one
who is familiar with the general run of English rhythmical translations,
of which Pope&rsquo;s Iliad is the pattern, must be aware that they have too
often been executed under the influence of the former of these
principles rather than the latter. In Pope&rsquo;s Homer, and in Sotheby&rsquo;s
also, I must add, we find many, perhaps all the finest passages very
finely done; but so as Pope or Sotheby might have done themselves in an
original poem written at the present day, while that which is most
peculiarly Homeric, a certain blunt naturalness and a talkative
simplicity, we do not find in these translators at all. The very things
which most strike the eye of the accomplished connoisseur, and feed the
meditations of the student of human nature, are omitted.
</p>

<p>
Now, I at once admit that a good prose translation&mdash;that is to say, a
prose translation done by a poet or a man of poetical culture&mdash;of such
an author as Homer, is preferable, for many purposes, to a poetical
translation so elegantly defaced as that of Pope. A prose translation,
also, of any poet, done accurately in a prosaic style by a proser,
however much of a parody or a caricature in point of taste, may not be
without its use, if in no other way, as a ready check on the free
licence of omission or inoculation which rhythmical translators are so
fond to usurp. But it is a mistake to suppose, because Pope, under the
influence of Louis XIV. and Queen Anne, could not <span class="pagenum">{4}</span> write a good
poetical translation of Homer, that therefore such a work is beyond the
compass of the English language.<sup><a href="#f_p_02b" id="f_p_02a">2</a></sup> I believe that, if Alfred
Tennyson were to give the world a translation of the Iliad in the
measure of <i>Locksley Hall</i>, he would cut Pope out of the market of the
million, even at this eleventh hour. We are, in the present epoch of our
literary history, arrived at a very favourable moment for producing good
translations. A band of highly-original and richly-furnished minds has
just left the stage, leaving us the legacy of a poetical language which,
under their hand, received a degree of rhythmical culture, of which it
had been before considered incapable. The example of the Germans, also,
now no longer confined to the knowledge of a few, stands forth to show
us how excellent poetical translations may be made, free, at least, from
those faults from which we have suffered. There is no reason why we
should despair of producing poetical versions of the Classics which
shall be at once graceful as English compositions, and characteristic as
productions of the Greek or Roman mind. I, for one, have already passed
this judgment on my own attempt, that if I have failed in these pages to
bring out what is Greek and what is Æschylean prominently, in
combination with force, grace, and clearness of English expression, it
is for lack of skill in the workman, not for want of edge in the tool.
</p>

<p>
The next question that calls for answer is: it being admitted that a
rhythmical translation of a Greek poem is preferable to a prose one,
should we content ourselves with a blank rhythm (such as Shelley has
used in Queen Mab, and Southey in Thalaba), or should we adopt also the
sonorous ornament of rhyme. On this subject, when I first commenced this
translation, about twelve years ago, I confess my feelings were strongly
against the use of rhyme in translations from the antique; but
experience and reflection have taught me considerably to modify, and, in
some points of view, altogether to abandon this opinion. With regard to
this matter, <span class="sc">Southey</span> has expressed himself thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Rhyme is to
passages of no inherent merit what rouge and candle-light are to
ordinary faces. Merely ornamental passages, also, are aided by it, as
foil sets off paste. But when there is either passion or power, the
plainer and more straightforward the language can be made, the
better.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#f_p_03b" id="f_p_03a">3</a></sup> This is the lowest ground on which the plea for rhyme
can be put; but even thus, it will be impossible for a discriminating
translator to ward off its application to the Greek tragedy. In all
poetry written for music, there will <span class="pagenum">{5}</span> occur, even from the best
poets, not a few passages on which the mere reader will pronounce, in
the language of Horace, that they are comparatively
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">&ldquo;Inopes rerum nugaeque canorae.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
To these, rhyme is indispensable. Without this, these &ldquo;trifles&rdquo; will
lose that which alone rendered them tolerable to the ancient ear; they
will cease to be &ldquo;canorous.&rdquo; One must consider at what a disadvantage an
ancient composer of &ldquo;a goat-song&rdquo; is placed, when the studiously
modulated phrase which he adapted to the cheerful chirpings of the lyre,
or the tumultuous blasts of the flute, is torn away from that
music-watered soil which was its life, and placed dry and bloodless on
the desk of a modern reader, beside the thought-pregnant periods of a
Coleridge, and the curiously-elaborated stanzas of a Wordsworth. Are we
to make him even more blank and disconsolate, by refusing him those
tuneful closes of modern rhythmical language, which scarcely our
sternest masters of the lyre can afford to disdain? It appears to me
that rhyme is so essential an accomplishment of lyrical language,
according to English use, that a translator is not doing justice to his
author who habitually rejects it. I have accordingly adopted it more or
less in every play, except the <span class="sc">Prometheus</span>, the calm statuesque
massiveness of which seemed to render the common decorations of lyric
poetry dispensable. In the <span class="sc">Seven against Thebes</span>, I have, in the first
two choral chaunts, rhymed only in the closes; and in the opening chorus
of the Agamemnon, I have used irregular rhyme. In the <span class="sc">Furies</span>, again,
I have allowed myself to be borne along in the most free and luxuriant
style of double rhyme of which I was capable, partly, I suppose, because
my admiration of that piece stimulated all my energies to their highest
pitch; partly, because, there being no question that the lyric metre of
the tragedians exhibits the full power of their language, the translator
is not doing justice to the work who does not endeavour, as far as may
be, to bring out the full power of his. The fact of the matter is, the
translator&rsquo;s art is always more or less of the nature of a compromise.
If the indulgence of a luxuriant freedom is apt to trench on accuracy,
the observance of a strict verbal accuracy is ill compatible with that
grace and elasticity of movement without which poetry has no existence.
In the present translation, I have been willing to try several styles,
if not to suit the humour of different readers, (which, however, were
anything but an illegitimate object), at least to satisfy myself what
could be done.
</p>

<p>
I shall now say a word on the principles which I have adopted with
regard to the representation of the various Greek metres by <span class="pagenum">{6}</span>
corresponding varieties of English verse. I say <i>corresponding</i> or
<i>analogous</i> emphatically; for, whatever apish tricks the Germans may
have taught their pliant tongue to play, the conservative English ear,
&ldquo;peculiarly intolerant of metrical innovations,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#f_p_04b" id="f_p_04a">4</a></sup> will not allow
itself to be seduced&mdash;whether by the arguments of Southey, or the
example of Longfellow&mdash;from the familiar harmonies of our old Saxon
measures. Nor, indeed, is this stiffness of native metrical habit, a
circumstance at all to be regretted. Every language has its own
measures, which are natural and easy to it, as every man has his own way
of walking, which he cannot forego for another, without affectation. I
do not think Goethe&rsquo;s Reineke Fuchs a whit the better, but rather the
worse, for being written in the measure of the Odyssey; and the
artificial choral versification of Humboldt, Franz, Schoemann, and
Müller, in their translations from Æschylus, is, to my ear, mere
metrical monstrosity, which would read much better if it were broken
down into plain prose.<sup><a href="#f_p_05b" id="f_p_05a">5</a></sup> I have, therefore, not attempted anything
of this kind in my translation, except accidentally; that is to say,
when the Greek measure happened to be at the same time an English
measure, as in the case of the Trochaic Tetrameter, of which the reader
will find examples in the conclusion of the <span class="sc">Agamemnon</span>, and in various
parts of the <span class="sc">Persians</span>. This measure, as Aristotle informs us,<sup><a href="#f_p_06b" id="f_p_06a">6</a></sup>
is a remnant of the old energetic triple time to which the sportive
Bacchic chorus originally danced; and, as it seems to be used by the
tragedians in passages where peculiar energy or elevation is
intended,<sup><a href="#f_p_07b" id="f_p_07a">7</a></sup> I do not think the translator is at liberty to
confound it in his version with the common dialogue. With regard to the
Iambic dialogue itself, there can be no question that our heroic blank
verse of ten syllables, both in point of character and compass, is the
natural and adequate representative of the Greek trimeter of
twelve.<sup><a href="#f_p_08b" id="f_p_08a">8</a></sup> The Anapæstic verse occasions more difficulty. The <span class="pagenum">{7}</span>
proper nature of this measure, as corresponding to our modern
<i>march-time</i> in music, has been pointed out by Müller;<sup><a href="#f_p_09b" id="f_p_09a">9</a></sup> and in
conformity with his views, I have, in my translation, accurately marked
the distinction, in the <span class="sc">Agamemnon</span>, the <span class="sc">Suppliants</span>, and the
<span class="sc">Persians</span>, between the Anapæstic verses sung by the Chorus to
march-time, when entering the Orchestra, and the regular odes or hymns
sung after they were arrived at their proper destination round the
Thymele. But how are we to render this verse in English? Our own
Anapæstic verse, though the same when counted by the fingers, has, if I
mistake not, a light, ambling, unsteady air about it, which is quite the
reverse of the weighty character of the &ldquo;equal rhythm,&rdquo; as the ancients
called both it and its counterpart the Dactylic.<sup><a href="#f_p_10b" id="f_p_10a">10</a></sup> I have,
therefore, thought myself safer in using, for this measure, the Trochaic
verse of eight syllables, varied with occasional sevens and fives,
generally without rhyme, in the <span class="sc">Agamemnon</span> with a few rhymes
irregularly interspersed. In the Persians only I have made the
experiment, tried also by Connington in the Agamemnon, of rendering the
Greek by the common English Anapæsts; the delicate-treading
(ἁβροβάται) sons of Susa not seeming to require the same
weight and firmness of diction for their sad vaticinations, as the
stout-hearted Titan for his words of haughty defiance, and the Herald of
the Thunderer for his threats.
</p>

<p>
With regard to the proper choral odes&mdash;the most difficult, and, in my
view, the most important part of my task&mdash;I have allowed myself a
licence, which some may think too large, but which, if I were to do the
work over again, I scarcely think I should contract. In very few cases
have I given anything like a curious imitation of the original; and,
when I have done so&mdash;as in the Trochaic Chaunt of the <span class="sc">Furies</span>,
<a href="#pg157">p. 157</a>, and in the Cretics mingled with Trochees, in the short ode of
the <span class="sc">Suppliants</span>, <a href="#pg232">p. 232</a><sup><a href="#f_p_11b" id="f_p_11a">11</a></sup>&mdash;it was more to humour the
whim of the moment than from any fixed principle. For, to speak truth,
rhyming men will have their whim; and I do not think it politic or
judicious to deprive the translator altogether of that rhythmical
freedom which is the great delight of the original composer. <span class="pagenum">{8}</span> But
another, and the principal reason with me for not attempting a
systematic imitation of the choral measures, was, that many of them
failed to produce, on my ear, an intelligible musical effect, which I
could set myself to reproduce; while, in other cases, though I clearly
saw the <i>rhythmical principle</i> on which they were constructed (for I do
not speak of the blind jargon of inherited <i>metrical terminology</i>), I
saw with equal clearness <i>that in our English poetry written to be read,
systematic imitation of ancient metres written on musical principles,
and with a view to musical exhibition, is, in the majority of cases,
altogether absurd and impertinent</i>. I confined myself, therefore, to the
selection of such English metres as to my ear seemed most dramatically
to represent the feeling of the original, making a marked contrast
everywhere between the rhythmical movement of joy and sorrow, and always
distinguishing carefully between what was piled up with a stable
continuity of sublime emotion, and what was ejaculated in a hurried and
broken style, where the Dochmiac verse prevails.<sup><a href="#f_p_12b" id="f_p_12a">12</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
So much for metres. With regard to the more strictly linguistic part of
my task, I have only to say that I thought it proper to assume
Wellauer&rsquo;s cautiously edited text as a safe general foundation, with the
liberty, of course, to deviate from it whenever I saw distinct and
clearly made out grounds. The other editions, old and new, which I have
used are enumerated in an <a href="#loe_top">Appendix</a> at the end of this book.
There also will be found those Commentaries and Translations which I
have consulted on all the difficult passages; my obligations to which
are, of course, great, and are here gratefully acknowledged. I desire
specially to name, as having been of most service to me, <span class="sc">Linwood</span>,
<span class="sc">Peile</span>, and <span class="sc">Paley</span> among the English; <span class="sc">Wellauer</span>, <span class="sc">Welcker</span>,
<span class="sc">Müller</span>, and <span class="sc">Schoemann</span> among the German scholars. My manner of
proceeding with previous English translations was to borrow from them an
occasional phrase or hint, only after I had finished and carefully
revised my own. But my obligations in respect of poetical diction to my
fellow-labourers in the same field are very few, and are for the most
part specially acknowledged.
</p>

<p>
The introductory remarks to each play are intended to supply the English
reader with that particular mythological or historical knowledge, and to
inspire him with those Hellenic views and feelings, <span class="pagenum">{9}</span> which are
necessary to the enjoyment of the different dramas. The appended notes
proceed on the principle, generally understood in this country, though
apparently neglected in erudite Germany, that translations are made, not
for the learned mainly, but for the unlearned. I have, therefore, not
assumed even the most common points of mythological and antiquarian
lore. Some of the notes, especially those on moral and religious points,
have a higher view than mere explanation. They are intended to stir
those human feelings, and suggest those trains of moral reflection
without which the most profound scholarship issues only in a
multitudinous cracking of empty nut-shells, and a ghastly exhibition of
gilded bones. The few notes of a strictly hermeneutical character that
are mingled with these, are mere jottings to preserve for my own use,
and that of my fellow-students of the Greek text, the grounds of
decision which have moved me in some of the more difficult passages,
where I have either departed from Wellauer&rsquo;s text, or where something
appeared to lie in the various renderings fraught with a more than
common poetical significance. In the general case, however, the
translation must serve as its own commentary; and, though I do not
pretend to have read every thing that has been written on the disputed
passages of this most difficult, and, in many places, sadly corrupt
author, I hope there is evidence enough in every page of my work to show
that I have conscientiously grappled with all real difficulties in any
way affecting the meaning of the text, and not leapt to a conclusion
merely because it was the most obvious and most convenient one. If here
and there I have made a rapid dash, a headlong plunge, or a bold sweep,
beyond the rules of a strict philology, it was because these were the
only tactics that the desperation of the case allowed.<sup><a href="#f_p_13b" id="f_p_13a">13</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, I am glad to take this opportunity of publicly returning
my thanks to two gentlemen of well-known literary taste and discernment,
who took the trouble to read my sheets as they went through the press,
and favour me with their valuable suggestions.

ON THE GENIUS AND CHARACTER
OF THE GREEK TRAGEDY

&ldquo;In der Beurtheilung des Hellenischen Alterthums soll der Scharfsinnige

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">The</span> reader will have observed that the word <span class="sc">tragedy</span>, which is
generally associated with the works of Æschylus, does not occur either
in the general title-page of this translation, or in the special
superscriptions of the separate pieces; in the one place the designation
&ldquo;<span class="sc">Lyrical Dramas</span>&rdquo; being substituted, and in the other &ldquo;<span class="sc">Lyrico-dramatic
Spectacle</span>.&rdquo; This change of the common title, by which these productions
are known in the book-world, was not made from mere affectation, or the
desire of singularity, but from the serious consideration that &ldquo;the
world is governed by names,&rdquo; and that the word &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; cannot be used
in reference to a serious lyrico-dramatic exhibition on the ancient
Greek stage, without importing a host of modern associations that will
render all healthy sympathy with the Æschylean drama, and all sound
criticism, extremely difficult. Names, indeed, are a principal part of
the hereditary machinery with which the evil Spirit of Error in the
region of thought, as well as in that of action, juggles the plain
understandings of men that they become the sport of every quibble, and
believe a lie. By means of names the plastic soul of man contrives at
first, often crudely enough, to express some part of a great truth, and
make it publicly recognised; but when, in the course of natural growth
and progress the thing has been altered, while the word, transmitted
from age to age, and itinerant from East to West, remains; then the
vocal sign performs its natural functions as a signifier of thought no
longer, but is as a mask, which either tells a complete lie, or looks
with the one-half of its face a meaning which the other half (seen only
by the learned) is sure to contradict. I have, therefore, thought it
convenient to do away with this cause of misunderstanding in the
threshold: and the purpose of the few remarks that follow is to make
plain to the understanding of the most unlearned the reason of the
terminology which I have adopted, and guard him yet more fully against
the misconceptions which are <span class="pagenum">{11}</span> sure to arise from suffering his
chamber of thought to be preoccupied by the echoes of a false
nomenclature.
</p>

<p>
If the modern spectator of a tragedy of Shakespere or Sheridan Knowles
comes from the vivid embodiments of a Faucit or a Macready, to the
perusal of what are called the &ldquo;tragedies of Æschylus,&rdquo; and applies the
subtle rules of representative art there exemplified, to the extant
remains of the early Greek stage, though he will find some things
strikingly conceived and grandly expressed, and a general tone of poetic
elevation, removed alike from what is trivial, and what is morbid; yet
he must certainly be strangely blinded by early classical
prepossessions, if he fails to feel that, as a whole, a Greek tragedy,
when set against the English composition of the same name, is
exceedingly narrow in its conception, meagre in its furniture,
monotonous in its character, unskilful in its execution, and not seldom
feeble in its effort. No doubt a generous mind will be disposed to look
with a kindly and even a reverent sympathy on the inferiority of the
infant fathers of that most difficult of all the poetic arts, which has
now, in this late age of the world, under the manly British training,
exhibited such sturdiness of trunk, such kingliness of stature, and such
magnificence of foliage; it may be also, that the novelty and the
strangeness of some things in the Greek tragedy&mdash;to those at least who
have not had their appetite palled by early Academic appliances&mdash;may
afford a pleasant compensation for what must appear its glaring
improprieties as falling under the category of a known genus of poetic
art; still, to the impartial and experienced frequenter of a first-rate
modern theatre, the first effect of an acquaintance with the old Greek
tragedy is apt to be disappointment. He will wonder what there is in
these productions so very remarkable that the select youth of Great
Britain should, next to their mother&rsquo;s milk, be made to suck in them,
and and them only, as the great intellectual nutriment of the
fresh-fledged soul, till, in the regular course of things, they are fit
to be fed on Church and State controversies and Parliamentary reports,
and other diet not always of the lightest digestion; and he will be apt
to imagine that in this, as in other cases, an over-great reverence for
antiquity has made sensible men bow the knee to idols&mdash;that learned
professors, like other persons, have their hobby-horses, which they are
fond of over-riding&mdash;and that no sane man should believe more than the
half of what is said by a professional trumpeter. All this will be very
right in the circumstances, and very true so far. But the frequenter of
the modern theatre must consider farther&mdash;if he wishes to be
just&mdash;whether he be not violating one of <span class="pagenum">{12}</span> the great proprieties of
nature, in rushing at once from the narrow confined gas-lighted boxes of
a modern theatre into the large sweeping sun-beshone tiers of an ancient
one. No man goes from a ball-room into a church without a certain decent
interval, and, if possible, a few moments of becoming preparation. So it
is with literary excursions. We must be acclimatized in the new country
before we can feel comfortable. We must not merely deliver our criticism
thus (however common such a style may be)&mdash;<i>I expected to find that; I
find this; and I am disappointed;</i> but we must ask the deeper and the
only valuable question&mdash;<i>What ought I to have expected to find, what
shall I surely find of good, and beautiful, and true, if my eyes are
open, and my free glance pointed in the right direction?</i> In short, if a
man will enjoy and judge a Greek &ldquo;tragedy,&rdquo; he must seek to know not
what it is in reference to the general idea of tragedy which he brings
with him from modern theatrical exhibitions, but what it was to the
ancient Greeks, sitting in the open air, on their wooden bench, or on
their seat hewn from the native rock, with the merry Bacchic echoes in
their ears, long before Aristotle laid down those nice rules of tragic
composition which only Shakespere might dare to despise.
</p>

<p>
Let us inquire, therefore, setting aside alike Shakesperian examples and
Aristotelian canons, what the τραγῳδία, or &ldquo;tragedy,&rdquo; was to
the ancient Greeks. Nor have we far to seek. The name, when the modern
paint is rubbed off, declares its own history; and we find that the main
idea of the old word τραγῳδία&mdash;as, by the way, the <i>only</i> idea of
the modern word τραγουδι<sup><a href="#f_on_01b" id="f_on_01a">1</a></sup>&mdash;is <span class="sc">a song</span>. Of the second
part of this word, we have preserved the root in our English words
<i>ode</i>, <i>melody</i>, <i>monody</i>, <i>threnody</i>, and the other half of the word
means <i>goat</i>; whether that descriptive addition to the principal
substantive came from the circumstance that the song was originally sung
by persons habited like goats,<sup><a href="#f_on_02b" id="f_on_02a">2</a></sup> or from other circumstances
connected with the worship of Dionysus, to whom this animal was sacred,
is of no importance for our present purpose. The main fact to which we
have to direct attention, is that the word <i>tragedy</i>, when analysed,
bears upon its face, and in the living Greek tongue proclaims loudly to
the present hour, that the essential character of this species of
poetry&mdash;when the name was originally given to it&mdash;was lyrical, and <span class="pagenum">{13}</span>
not at all dramatic or tragic, in the modern sense of these words. A
drama, in modern language, means an action represented by acting
persons; and a tragedy is such a represented action, having a sad issue;
but neither of these elements belonged to the original Greek tragedy, as
inherited from his rude predecessors by Æschylus, nor (as we shall
immediately show) do they form the prominent or characteristic part of
that exhibition, as transmitted by him to his successors. With regard to
the origin of the Greek &ldquo;goat-song,&rdquo; and its condition previous to the
age of Æschylus, there is but one uncontradicted voice of tradition on
the subject; the curious discussions and investigations of the learned
affecting only certain minute points of detail in the progress, which
have no interest for the general student. That tradition is to the
effect that the Greek lyrical drama, as we find it in the extant works
of Æschylus, arose out of the Dithyrambic hymns sung at the sacred
festivals of the ancient Hellenes in honour of their god Dionysus, or,
as he is vulgarly called, Bacchus; hymns which were first extemporized
under the influence of the stimulating juice of the grape,<sup><a href="#f_on_03b" id="f_on_03a">3</a></sup> and
then sung by a regularly trained Chorus, under the direction of the
famous Methymnean minstrel, Arion.<sup><a href="#f_on_04b" id="f_on_04a">4</a></sup> The simplest form which such
hymns, under such conditions, could assume, was that of a circular dance
by a band of choristers round the statue or the altar of the god in
whose honour the hymn was sung. This is not a matter peculiar to Greece,
but to be found at all times, and all over the world, wherever there are
men who are not mere brutes. So in the description of the religious
practices of the ancient Mexicans, our erudite poet <span class="sc">Southey</span> has the
following beautiful passage, picturing a sacred choral dance round the
altar of sacrifice:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i8">Round the choral band</p>
<p class="i0">The circling nobles gay, with gorgeous plumes,</p>
<p class="i0">And gems which sparkled to the midnight fire,</p>
<p class="i0">Moved in the solemn dance; each in his hand,</p>
<p class="i0">In measured movements, lifts the feathery shield,</p>
<p class="i0">And shakes a rattling ball to measured sounds;</p>
<p class="i0">With quicker steps, the inferior chiefs without,</p>
<p class="i0">Equal in number, but in just array,</p>
<p class="i0">The spreading radii of the mystic wheel</p>
<p class="i0">Revolved; and outermost, the youths roll round,</p>
<p class="i0">In motions rapid as their quickened blood.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
Now, according to the general tradition of old Greek commentators and
lexicographers, the Dithyramb or Bacchic Hymn was also called a
<i>Circular Hymn</i><sup><a href="#f_on_05b" id="f_on_05a">5</a></sup> an expression which a celebrated Byzantine
writer has interpreted to mean &ldquo;<i>a hymn sung by a chorus standing in a
ring round the altar.</i>&rdquo;<sup><a href="#f_on_06b" id="f_on_06a">6</a></sup> It is, no doubt, true that the phrase
χορὸς κύκλιος, or circular chorus, does not necessarily
mean a chorus of this description; the term, as has been ingeniously
observed,<sup><a href="#f_on_07b" id="f_on_07a">7</a></sup> like our own word <i>roundelay</i>, and the German
<i>Rund-gesang</i>, being capable of an equally natural application to a hymn
composed of parts, that run back to the point from which they started,
and form, as it were, a circle of melody. But, whatever etymologists may
make of the word, the fact that there were hymns sung by the ancient
Greeks in chorus round the altars of their gods is not denied; and
seems, indeed, so natural and obvious, that we shall assume it as the
first form of the &ldquo;goat-song,&rdquo; in which form it continued up to a period
which it is impossible to define; the only certainty being that,
whereas, in olden times, it was composed of fifty men, it was afterwards
diminished to twelve or fifteen, and arranged in the form of a military
company in regular rank and file.<sup><a href="#f_on_08b" id="f_on_08a">8</a></sup> Such a chorus, therefore, was
the grand central trunk out of which the Attic tragedy branched and
bloomed to such fair luxuriance of verbal melody. We shall now trace, if
we can, the natural steps of progress.
</p>

<p>
Let us suppose that the Leader of a Chorus, trained to sing hymns in
honour of the gods, is going to make them sing publicly a hymn <span class="pagenum">{15}</span> in
honour of Ζεύς ἱκέσιος&mdash;Jove, in his benign character as the
friend of the friendless, and the protector of suppliants. Instead of a
vague general supplication in the abstract style to which we are
accustomed in our forms of prayer, what could be more natural than for a
susceptible and lively Greek to conceive the persons of the Chorus as
engaged in some particular act of supplication, well known in the sacred
traditions of the people, whose worship he was leading, and to put words
in their mouths suitable to such a situation? This done, we have at once
<i>drama</i>, according to the etymological meaning of the word; that is to
say, a represented <i>action</i>. The Chorus represents certain persons, we
shall say, the daughters of Danaus, fugitives from their native Libya,
arrived on the stranger coast of Argolis, and in the act of presenting
their supplications to their great celestial protector. Such an
exhibition, if we will not permit it to be called by the substantive
name of <i>drama</i>, is, at all events, a dramatized hymn; an ode so
essentially dramatic in its character, that it requires but the addition
of a single person besides the Chorus to form a complete action; for an
action, like a colloquy, is necessarily between two parties&mdash;meditation,
not action, being the natural business of a solitary man. Now, the
single person whose presence is required to turn this dramatized hymn
into a proper lyrical drama is already given. The Leader of the Chorus,
or the person to whom the singing band belonged, and who superintended
its exhibitions, is such a person. He has only, in the case supposed, to
take upon himself the character of the person, the king of the Argives,
to whom the supplication is made, to indicate, by word or gesture, the
feelings with which he receives their address, and finally to accept or
reject their suit; this makes a complete action, and a lyrical drama
already exists in all essentials, exactly such as we read the skeleton
of it at the present hour, in the <span class="sc">Suppliants</span> of Æschylus. To go a
step beyond this, and add (as has been done in our play) another actor
to represent the party pursuing the fugitives, is only to bring the
situation already existing to a more violent issue, and not essentially
to alter the character of the exhibition. Much less will the mere
appendage of a guide or director to the main body of the Chorus, in the
shape of a father, brother, or other accessory character, change the
general effect of the spectacle. The great central mass which strikes
the eye, and fills ear and heart with its harmonious appeals, remains
still what it was, even before the leader of the band took a part in the
lyric exhibition. The dramatized lyric, and the lyrical drama, differ
from one another only according to the simile already used, as a tree
with two or three branches differs from a tree with a simple stem. <span class="pagenum">{16}</span>
The main body and stamina are the same in each. The <span class="sc">Song</span> is the soul
of both.
</p>

<p>
The academic student, who is familiar with these matters, is aware that
what has been here constructed hypothetically, as a natural result of
the circumstances, is the real historical account of the origin and
progress of the Greek tragedy, as it is shortly given in a well-known
passage of Diogenes Laertius. &ldquo;In the oldest times,&rdquo; says that
biographer of the philosophers, &ldquo;the Chorus alone went through the
dramatic exhibition (διεδραματίζεν) in tragedy; afterwards
Thespis, to give rest to the Chorus, added one actor distinct from the
singers; then Æschylus added a second, and Sophocles a third; which
gave to tragedy its complete development.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#f_on_09b" id="f_on_09a">9</a></sup> The reason mentioned
here for the addition of the first actor by Thespis, is a very probable
one. The convenience or ease of the singers contributed, along with the
lively wit of the Greeks, and a due regard for the entertainment of the
spectators, to raise the dramatized ode, step by step, into the lyrical
drama.
</p>

<p>
In the above account, two secondary circumstances connected with this
transition, have not been mentioned. The <i>first</i> is, that the jocund and
sometimes boisterous hymn, in honour of the wine-god, should have passed
into the lyrical representation of an action generally not at all
connected with the worship or history of that divinity; and, <i>secondly</i>,
that this action should have changed its tone from light to grave, from
jocular to sad, and become, in fact, what we, in the popular language of
modern times, call <i>tragic</i>. Now, for the first of these circumstances,
I know nothing that can be said in the way of historical philosophy,
except that man is fond of variety, that the Greek genius was fertile,
and that accident often plays strange tricks with the usages and
institutions of mortal men. For the other point, there can be no doubt
that the worship of the god of physical and animal joy, being violent in
its character, had its ebb as well as its flow, its broad-gleaming
sunshine not without the cloud, its wail as well as its rejoicing.
Whether Dionysus meant the sun, or only wine, which is the produce of
the solar heat, or both, it is plain that his worshippers would have to
lament his departure, at least as often as they hailed his advent; and,
in this natural alternation, a foundation was laid for the separation of
the original Dithyrambic <span class="pagenum">{17}</span> Chorus into a wild, sportive element,
represented by the Aristophanic comedy, and a deeply serious, meditative
element represented by tragedy. But we must beware, in reference to
Æschylus at least, of supposing that the lyrical drama, as exhibited by
him, however solemn and awe-inspiring, was necessarily sad, or, as we
say, tragic in its issue. Aristotle indeed, in his famous treatise, lays
down the doctrine that the main object of tragic composition is to
excite pity and terror, and that Euripides, &ldquo;though in other respects he
manages badly, is in this respect the most tragic of the tragedians,
that the most of his pieces end unfortunately.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#f_on_10b" id="f_on_10a">10</a></sup> But there is
not the slightest reason, in the nature of things, why a solemn dramatic
representation, any more than a high-toned epical narrative, should end
unfortunately. The Hindoo drama, for one, never does;<sup><a href="#f_on_11b" id="f_on_11a">11</a></sup> and, in
the case of our poet, it is plain that the great trilogy, of which the
Orestes is the middle piece, is constructed upon the principle of
leading the sympathizing spectator through scenes of pity and terror, as
stations in a journey, but finally to a goal of moral peace and
harmonious reconciliation. That the great trilogy of the <span class="sc">Prometheus</span>,
of which only one part remains, had an equally fortunate termination, is
not to be doubted. Here, therefore, we see another impertinence in that
modern word <i>tragedy</i>, which, in the superscriptions of these plays, I
have been so careful to eschew.
</p>

<p>
We shall now examine one or two of the Æschylean pieces by a simple
arithmetical process, and see how essentially the lyrical element
predominates in their construction. Taking Wellauer&rsquo;s edition, and
turning up the <span class="sc">Suppliants</span>, I find that that play, consisting
altogether of 1055 lines, is opened by a continuous lyric strain of 172
lines. Then we have dialogue, in part of which the Chorus uses lyric
measures to the extent of 22 lines. Then follows a short choral song of
only 20 lines. The next Chorus comprises 76 lines, and the next 70.
After this follows another dialogue, in which the Chorus, being in great
mental agitation, use, according to the uniform practice of Æschylus,
lyric measures to the extent altogether of 20 verses. Then follows
another regular choral hymn of 47 lines. After that a violent lyrical
altercation between the Chorus and a new actor, to the amount of 74
lines, in the most impassioned lyrical rhythm. Then follow 14 lines of
anapæsts; and the whole concludes with a grand lyrical finale of 65
lines: altogether 580&mdash;considerably more than the half of the piece by
bare arithmetic, and equal to two-thirds of it fully, if we consider how
much more time the singing, with the musical accompaniments, must have
occupied than the simple <span class="pagenum">{18}</span> declamation. No more distinct proof could
be required how essentially the account of Diogenes Laertius is right;
how true it is that the choral part of the Æschylean drama is both its
body and its soul, while the dialogic part, to use the technical
language of Aristotle&rsquo;s days, was, in fact, only an ἐπεισόδιον (from
which our English word <i>Episode</i>) or thing thrown in between the main
choral acts of the representation, for the sake of variety to the
spectators, and, as the writer says, of rest to the singers. We thus
see, also, what an incorrect and indefinite idea of the Æschylean drama
Aristotle had when he says&mdash;so far as we can gather his meaning&mdash;that
&ldquo;Æschylus first added a second actor; he also abridged the chorus, and
made the dialogue the principal part of tragedy.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#f_on_12b" id="f_on_12a">12</a></sup> The last
article, so far as the play of the <span class="sc">Suppliants</span> is concerned, is simply
not true. Let us make trial of another play. The <span class="sc">Agamemnon</span>, which, for
many reasons, is one of the best for testing the mature genius of the
bard, contains about 1600 lines; and, without troubling the reader with
details, it will be found that about the half of this number is written
in lyric measures. When we consider, further, that the most splendid
imaginative pictures, and the wildest bursts of passion, all the
interest, the doubt, and the anxiety, the fear, the terror, the surprise,
and the final issue, are, according to the practice of Æschylus,
regularly thrown into lyric measures, we shall be convinced that
Aristotle (if we rightly apprehend him) was altogether mistaken when he
led the moderns to imagine that the father of tragedy had really given
such a preponderance to the dialogic element, that the lyric part is to
be looked on, in his productions, as in any way subordinate. Unless it
be the <span class="sc">Prometheus</span>, I do not know a single extant play of Æschylus in
which the lyric element occupies a position which, in actual
representation, would justify the dictum of the Stagyrite. And even in
this play, let it be observed, how grandly the poet makes his anapæsts
swell and billow with sonorous thunder in the finale; as if to make
amends for the somewhat prolix epic recitals with which he had occupied
the spectator, and to prove that a Greek tragedy could never be true to
itself, unless it left upon the ear, in its last echoes, the permanent
impression of its original character as a <span class="sc">Song</span>.
</p>

<p>
Three observations strike me, that may conveniently be stated as
corollaries from the above remarks. <i>First</i>, That those translators have
erred who, whether from carelessness, or from ignorance, or from a
desire to accommodate the ancient tragedy as much as possible to the
modern, have given an undue predominance to blank <span class="pagenum">{19}</span> verse in their
versions, making it appear as if the spoken part of the Æschylean
tragedy bore a much larger proportion, than it really does, to the sung.
<i>Second</i>, Those critics have erred who, applying the principles of
modern theatrical criticism to the chaunted parts of the ancient lyrical
drama, have found many parts dull or wearisome, extravagant, and even
ridiculous, which, there can be no doubt, with their proper musical
accompaniment, were the most impressive, and the most popular parts of
the representation. <i>Third</i>, We err altogether, when we judge of the
excellence of an ancient Greek drama as a composition, by its effect on
us when reading it. The <span class="sc">Suppliants</span>, for instance, is generally
considered a stupid play; because it wants grand contrasts of character
and striking dramatic situations, and contains so much of mere
reiterated supplication. But this reiteration, though wearisome to us
who read the text-book of the lost opera, was, in all probability, that
on which the ravished ears of the devout ancient auditors dwelt with
most voluptuous delight. In general, without re-creating some musical
accompaniment, and dwelling with ear and heart on the frequent
variations of the lyric burden of the piece, a man is utterly incapable
of passing any sane judgment on an Æschylean drama. Such a piece may
contain in abundance everything that the auditors desired and enjoyed,
and yet be very stupid now to us who merely read and criticise.
</p>

<p>
The fact of the matter is, that the marshalled band of singers, however
satisfactory to an ancient audience, who looked principally for musical
excitement in their tragedies, and not for an interesting plot, was not
at all calculated for allowing a dramatic genius to bring out those
tragic situations in which the modern reader delights; but rather stood
directly in the way of such an effect. The fine development of character
under the influence of various delicate situations, and in collision
with different persons, all acting their part in some complex knot of
various-coloured life, could not be exhibited in a performance where a
band of singers on whom the eye of the spectators principally rested,
and who formed the great attraction for the masses,<sup><a href="#f_on_13b" id="f_on_13a">13</a></sup> constantly
occupied the central ground, and constantly interfered with every thing
that was either said or done, whether it was convenient for them to do
so or not. For a perfect tragedy, as conceived scientifically by
Aristotle, and executed with a grand practical instinct by Shakespere,
the Chorus was, in the very nature <span class="pagenum" id="pg020">{20}</span> of the thing, an incumbrance and
an impediment. It was only very seldom that the persons of that body
could form such an important part of the action, and come forward with
such a startling dramatic effect as in the Eumenides. Too often they
were obliged to hang round the action as an atmosphere, or look at it as
spectators; spectators either impartial altogether, and then too wise
for dramatic sympathy, or half-partial, and then, by indecision of
utterance, often making themselves ridiculous, as in a noted scene of
the Agamemnon (p. <a href="#pg081">81</a>), or contemptible, as in the
Antigone.<sup><a href="#f_on_14b" id="f_on_14a">14</a></sup> The proper position of the Chorus in a regularly
constructed drama, is, like the witches in Macbeth, to form a mysterious
musical background (not a <i>fore</i>-ground, as in the Greek tragedy), or to
circle, as in the opera of Masaniello, the principal character with a
band of associates naturally situated to assist and cheer him on to his
grand enterprise. But the Greek Chorus, even in the time of Sophocles
and Euripides, who enlarged the spoken part, was too independent, too
stationary, too central a nucleus of the representation, not to impede
the movements of the acting persons who performed the principal parts.
As a form of art, therefore, the Greek tragedy, so soon as it attempted
to assume the scientific ground so acutely seized on by the subtle
analysis of Aristotle, was necessarily clumsy and incongruous. The lyric
element, which was always the most popular element, refused to be
incorporated with the acting element, and yet could not be altogether
displaced; a position of scenic affairs which has strangely perplexed
not a few modern critics, looking for a dramatic plot with all the
dramatic proprieties in a composition where the old Hellenic spectator
only felt a hymn to Jove; and curiously tasking their wits to find
excuses for a poet like Euripides, who, with blossoming lyrics and
sonorous rhetoric, might gain the prize of the &ldquo;goat-song,&rdquo; even over
the head of a Sophocles, and yet, in point of dramatic propriety, as we
demand it in our modern plays, be constantly perpetrating enormities
which a clever schoolboy at Westminster or Eton might avoid.<sup><a href="#f_on_15b" id="f_on_15a">15</a></sup>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{21}</span></p>

<p>
So much for the artistic form of the Æschylean drama. As for the
matter, it was essentially a combination of mythological, legendary, and
devotional elements, such as naturally belonged to a people whose
religion was intimately blended with every passion of the human heart,
and every chance of human life, and whose gods were only a sort of
glorified men, as their men sometimes were nothing less than mortal
gods. The Greek lyrical dramas were part of the great public exhibitions
at the great feasts of Bacchus, which took place, some in the winter
season, and some in the spring of the year;<sup><a href="#f_on_16b" id="f_on_16a">16</a></sup> and in this respect
they bear a striking resemblance both to the Hindoo dramas (for which
see <span class="sc">Wilson</span>), to the so-called mysteries and moralities of mediæval
piety, and to the sacred dramas of Metastasio, exhibited to the court at
Vienna. And what sort of an aspect does ancient polytheistic piety
present, what sort of an attitude does it maintain, in these
compositions? An aspect surprisingly fair, considering what motley
confusion it sprang from, an attitude singularly noble, seeing how
nearly it was allied to mere animal enjoyment, and how prone was its
degeneration into the mire of the grossest sensuality. The pictured
pages of Livy, and brazen tablets of the grave Roman senate still
extant, tell only too true a tale into what a fearful mire of
brutishness the fervent worship of Dionysus might plunge its votaries.
And yet out of this Bacchantic worship, so wild, so animal, and so
sensual, arose the Greek tragedy, confessedly amongst the most
high-toned moral compositions that the history of literature knows. Our
modern Puritans, who look upon the door of a theatre (according to the
phrase of a famous Edinburgh preacher) as the gate of hell, might take
any one of these seven plays which are here presented in an English
dress, and with the simple substitution of a few Bible designations for
Heathen ones, find, so far as moral and religious doctrine is concerned,
that, with the smallest possible exercise of the pruning-knife, they
might be exhibited in a Christian Church, and be made to subserve the
purposes of practical piety, as usefully as many a sermon. The following
passage from the Agamemnon is not a solitary gem from a heap of rubbish,
but the very soul and significance of the Æschylean drama:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">&ldquo;For Jove doth teach men wisdom, sternly wins</p>
<p class="i0">To virtue by the tutoring of their sins;</p>
<p class="i0">Yea! drops of torturing recollection chill</p>
<p class="i0">The sleeper&rsquo;s heart; &rsquo;gainst man&rsquo;s rebellious will</p>
<p class="i2">Jove works the wise remorse:</p>
<p class="i0">Dread Powers, on awful seats enthroned, compel</p>
<p class="i2">Our hearts with gracious force.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">{22}</span></p>

<p class="noindent">
The only serious charge that, to my knowledge, has ever been made
against the morality of the Greek drama, is that in it &ldquo;an innocent
person, one in the main of a virtuous character, through no crime of his
own, nay not by the vices of others, but through mere <span class="sc">Fatality and
Blind Chance</span>, is involved in the greatest of all human miseries.&rdquo; This
is the critical judgment of Dr. Blair (lecture xlvi.) in reference to
the famous Labdacidan story of Œdipus.<sup><a href="#f_on_17b" id="f_on_17a">17</a></sup> Now, though the
personal history of Œdipus contains many incidents that expose it
justly to criticism, especially when brought upon the stage in a
modernized dress by modern French or other poets (which abuse the
learned Doctor no doubt had principally in view); yet, as applied to the
whole Labdacidan story, or to the subjects of the Greek drama generally,
the allegation is either extremely shallow, or altogether false. There
is no destiny or fatality of any kind in the Æschylean drama, other
than that which, according to the Mosaic record, drove Adam out of
Paradise; that destiny which a divine decree, seeing the end in the
beginning, has prepared, and that fatality which makes a guilty man not
merely the necessary architect of his own misery, but the propagator of
a moral contagion, more or less, to the offspring that inherits his
pollution and his curse. On this subject I need make no lengthened
observations here, as I have brought it and other points of moral and
religious feeling prominently forward, both in the introductory
observations to the separate plays, and in various places of the notes.
I shall only say that the reader who does not find a high moral purpose
and a deep religious meaning in the specimens of ancient Greek worship
now submitted to his inspection, has no eye for what is best in these
pages, and had better throw the book down. The Germans, who look deeper
into these matters than we have either time, inclination, or, in the
general case, capacity to do, have written volumes on the
subject.<sup><a href="#f_on_18b" id="f_on_18a">18</a></sup> To me it has seemed more suitable to the genius of the
English reader merely to hint the existence of this rich mine of moral
wealth, leaving to the quiet thinker where, amid our various political
and ecclesiastical clamour, he may have found a corner, to work out the
vein with devout spade and mattock for himself.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{23}</span></p>

<p>
A few words must now be said on the <span class="sc">Dance</span>, as an essential part of the
lyrical element of the Greek tragedy. Our sober British, stern
Protestant, and precise Presbyterian notions, make it very difficult for
us to realize this peculiarity. Even the old Heathen Roman could say,
&ldquo;<span class="sc">Nemo fere saltat sobrius, nisi forte insanit</span>&rdquo;;<sup><a href="#f_on_19b" id="f_on_19a">19</a></sup> much more
must it be hard for a modern Presbyterian Christian to recognise, in the
twinkling-footed celerity of the merry dance, an exercise which a pious
old Dorian could look upon as an indispensable part of an act of public
worship. To read the weighty moral sentences of a solemn Æschylean
Chorus, and then figure to ourselves their author as a dancing-master,
is an unnatural and almost painful transition of thought to a Christian
man in these times; and yet Athenæus tells us, that the author of the
Prometheus really was a professor of the orchestric art, and a very
cunning one too.<sup><a href="#f_on_20b" id="f_on_20a">20</a></sup> The fundamental truth of the case is, that the
religion of the Greeks was not, like ours, a religion only of moral
emotions and theological principles, but a religion of the whole man,
with rather too decided a tendency, in some parts, it must be confessed,
towards a disturbance of the equipoise on the side of the senses. But,
whatever may be thought of Bacchic orgies and other associate rites,
with regard to dancing, there is plainly nothing in the exercise, when
decorously conducted, inconsistent either with dignity, or with piety;
and the feelings of ancient Romans and modern Presbyterians on the
subject, must be regarded as the mere products of arbitrary association.
Certain it is, that all the Greek philosophers looked upon dancing as an
essential element, not only in the education of a gentleman, but in the
performance of public worship; nay, even among the severe Jews, we read
that David, on occasion of a great religious festival, danced before the
Lord; and only an idle woman called him an idle fellow for doing so. We
need not be surprised, therefore, if among the merry Greeks, professing
a religion fully as much of physical enjoyment as of moral culture,
orchestric evolutions, along with sacred hymns, formed an essential part
of the tragic exhibitions belonging to the feasts of the great god
Dionysus. On the details of this matter, we are sadly wanting in
satisfactory information; but that the fact was so, there can be no
doubt.<sup><a href="#f_on_21b" id="f_on_21a">21</a></sup> The only point with regard to which there is room for a
serious difference of opinion is, whether every performance of the <span class="pagenum">{24}</span>
Chorus in full band included dancing, or whether it was only introduced
occasionally, as the ballet in our modern operas. On this point, the
greatest authority in Greek Literature at present living has declared
strongly in favour of the latter view; and, in doing so, he has been
followed by one of the first philologers of our own country;<sup><a href="#f_on_22b" id="f_on_22a">22</a></sup>
and as I have not been led, in the course of my studies, to make any
particular examination of this subject, I am loath to contradict
anything proceeding from such an authoritative quarter. One great branch
of the evidence, I presume, on which this view is supported, lies in the
words of the old Scholiast to the choral chaunt in the Phœnissae of
Euripides, beginning with these words, Τύριον (ὀ)ιδμα λιπῦσ῎ ἔβαν.
&ldquo;This chaunt,&rdquo; says the annotator, &ldquo;is what is called a στάσιμον, or
<i>standing</i> chorus; for when the Chorus, after the πάροδος, remaining
motionless, sings a hymn arising out of the subject of the play, this
song is called a στάσιμον. A πάροδος, on the other hand, is a song sung
as they are marching into the orchestra on the first entrance.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#f_on_23b" id="f_on_23a">23</a></sup>
Now, no doubt, if this matter be taken with a literal exactitude, the
expression, ἀκίνητος, or <i>without moving</i>, will exclude dancing; but if
we merely take it generally, as opposed to the great sweeping evolutions
of the Chorus, and as implying only a permanent occupation of the same
ground in the centre of the orchestra, by the band, as a whole, while
the individual members might change their places in the most graceful
and beautiful variety of forms, we are thus saved from the harshness of
giving to the orchestric element, in many plays, a subordinate position,
equally at variance with the original character of the Chorus, and with
the place which the dance held as a prominent part of Greek social
life.<sup><a href="#f_on_24b" id="f_on_24a">24</a></sup> With regard to Æschylus, in particular, I do not see how
I should be acting in consistency with the testimony of Athenæus just
quoted, if I were to assign such a small proportion of the choric
performances to orchestric accompaniment, as Boeckh and Donaldson have
done in their editions of the play of Sophocles, which the genius of
Miss Faucit has rendered so dear to the friends of the drama in this
country. It would be easy to show, from internal evidence such as Boeckh
finds in what he calls the Orchestric Chorus, or ἐμμέλεια of the
Antigone, that certain choruses of Æschylus are more adapted for
violent and extensive orchestric movements than others. But I have
thought it more prudent, considering <span class="pagenum">{25}</span> the general uncertainty that
surrounds this matter, not to make any allusion to dancing in any one
performance of the Chorus more than another; contenting myself with
carefully distinguishing everywhere between the anapæstic parts where
the Chorus is plainly making extensive movements, and the <span class="sc">Choral Hymn</span>
with regular Strophe and Antistrophe, which is sung when they are placed
in their proper position in a square band round the <i>Thymele</i> (θυμέλη),
or Bacchic altar, in the centre of the orchestra.<sup><a href="#f_on_25b" id="f_on_25a">25</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Having said so much with regard both to the form and substance of the
lyric portion of the Æschylean drama, I have said almost all that I was
anxious to say; for, in stating this matter clearly, I have brushed out
of the way the principal part of that host of modern associations which
is so apt to disturb our sympathetic enjoyment of the great masterpieces
of Hellenic art. Anything that might be said in detail on the iambic or
dialogic part of ancient tragedy would only serve to set in a yet
stronger light the grand fact which has been urged, that the strength of
the Greek drama lies in the singing, and not in the acting. It were easy
to show by an extensive analysis, that the classical &ldquo;goat-singers&rdquo; had
but very imperfect notions on the subject of stage dialogue; and that it
was a light thing for them to deal at large in mere epic description, or
rhetorical declamation, without offending the taste of a fastidious
audience, or sinning grossly against the understood laws of the sort of
composition which they exhibited.<sup><a href="#f_on_26b" id="f_on_26a">26</a></sup> Notwithstanding Aristotle&rsquo;s
nicely-drawn distinction, the narrated, or purely epic parts of the
Greek tragedy, are often the best. This is the case not seldom even with
Æschylus, whose native dramatic power the voice of a master has judged
to be first-rate.<sup><a href="#f_on_27b" id="f_on_27a">27</a></sup> But with him the infant state of the art, and
the insufficient supply of actors,<sup><a href="#f_on_28b" id="f_on_28a">28</a></sup> combined with a radical
faultiness of structure, produced, in not a few instances, the same
anti-dramatic results as the want of dramatic genius in Euripides.
Further, to <span class="pagenum">{26}</span> use the language of Mr. Donaldson&mdash;&ldquo;the narrowness and
distance of the stage rendered any (free and complex) grouping
unadvisable. The arrangement of the actors was that of a processional
bas relief. Their movements were slow, their gesticulations abrupt and
angular, and their delivery a sort of loud and deep-drawn sing-song,
which resounded throughout the immense theatre. They probably neglected
everything like <i>by-play</i> and <i>making points</i>, which are so effective on
the English stage. The distance at which the spectators were placed
would prevent them from seeing those little movements and hearing those
low tones which have made the fortune of many a modern actor. The mask,
too, precluded all attempts at varied expression, and it is probable
that nothing more was expected from the performer than was looked for
from his predecessor, the rhapsode&mdash;viz., good recitation.&rdquo; These
observations, flowing from a realization of the known circumstances of
the case, will sufficiently explain to the modern reader the extreme
stiffness and formality which distinguishes the tragic dialogue of the
Greeks from that dexterous and various play of verbal interchange which
delights us so much in Shakespere and the other masters of English
tragedy. Every view, in short, that we can take, tends to fix our
attention on the musical and the religious elements, as on the
life-blood and vital soul of the Hellenic τραγῳδία; forces us
to the conclusion that, with a due regard to organic principle, its
proper designation is <span class="sc">sacred opera</span>,<sup><a href="#f_on_29b" id="f_on_29a">29</a></sup> and not <span class="sc">tragedy</span>, in the
modern sense of the word <span class="pagenum">{27}</span> at all; and leads us to look on the
dramatic art altogether in the hands of Æschylus, not as an infant
Hercules strangling serpents, but as a Titan, like his own Prometheus,
chained to a rock, whom only, after many ages, a strong Saxon Shakespere
could unbind.
</p>

<p>
To conclude. If these observations shall seem to any conceived in a
style too depreciatory of the masterpieces of Hellenic art, such persons
will observe, that what has been here said of a negative character has
reference only to the form of these productions as works of art, and not
to their poetic contents. An unfortunate external arrangement is often,
as in the case of the German writer Richter, united in intimate
amalgamation with the richest and most exuberant energy of intellectual
and moral life. However imperfect the Greek &ldquo;tragedies&rdquo; are as forms of
artistic exhibition, they are not the less admirable, for the mass of
healthy poetic life of which they are the embodiment, and the grand
combination of artistic elements which they present. As among the
world&rsquo;s notable men there are some who are great rather by a harmonious
combination of the great healthy elements of humanity, than by the
gigantic development of any one faculty, so in literature there are
phenomena which must be measured by the mass of inward life which they
concentrate, not by the structural perfection of form which they
exhibit. The lyrical tragedy of the Greeks presents, in a combination
elsewhere unexampled, the best elements of our serious drama, our opera,
our oratorio, our public worship, and our festal recreations. The people
who prepared and enjoyed such an intellectual banquet were not
base-minded. Had their stability been equal to their susceptibility, the
world had never seen their equal. As it is, they are like to remain for
ages the great Hierophants of the intellectual world, whose influence
will always be felt even by those who are ignorant or impudent enough to
despise them; and among the various branches of art and science which
owed a felicitous culture to their dexterous and subtle genius, there is
certainly no phenomenon in the wide history of imaginative manifestation
more imposing and more significant than that which bears on its face the
signature of the rude god of wine, and his band of shaggy and
goat-footed revellers.

<span class="sc">The</span> richest heritage that a great dramatic poet can receive from the
past, is a various store of legendary tradition, in the shape of ballads
or popular epos; the greatest present blessing that can happen to him
from Heaven, is to live in an age when every mighty thought to which he
can give utterance finds a ready response in the hearts of the people,
urged by the memory of great deeds recently achieved, to aspire after
greater yet to come. Both these blessings were enjoyed by the founder of
the serious lyrical drama of the Greeks. In Homer, Æschylus recognised
his heritage from the past.<sup><a href="#f_tl_01b" id="f_tl_01a">1</a></sup> Marathon and Salamis were the first

Athenian, in the deme of Eleusis, of an ancient and noble family, he had
ample opportunity, by the contagion of the place, in his boyish days, of
brooding over those lofty religious ideas which formed the
characteristic inspiration of his drama,<sup><a href="#f_tl_02b" id="f_tl_02a">2</a></sup> Pausanias (I. 21)
relates of him that, on one occasion, when he was watching the vineyards
as a mere boy, Dionysus appeared to him and ordered him to write dramas.
Of this story, we may say that it either is true, literally, or invented
to symbolize something that must have been true. The next authentic fact
in the life of the poet, testified by Suidas, is that in his
twenty-fifth year (499, B.C.), the same in which Sardes was burnt by the
Ionians, he first appeared as a competitor for the tragic prize. But, as
the strongest intellectual genius is often that which, like the oak,
grows slowest, we do not find him registered as having actually gained
the prize in such a competition till the lapse of sixteen years.
Meanwhile, the soul of Greece had been called out at Marathon to prepare
the world, as it were, for <span class="pagenum">{29}</span> that brilliant display of
self-dependence which was afterwards made at Salamis. At both these
victories, which belonged to the world as much as to Greece, Æschylus
was present, as also, according to some accounts, at Artemisium and
Platæae&mdash;learning in all these encounters how much more noble it is to
act poetry than to sing it, and borrowing from them certain high
trumpet-notes of martial inspiration that stirred the soul deeper than
any that could have been fetched from the fountains of Helicon, or the
double peak of Parnassus. Braced in this best school of manhood, he
continued his exertions as a dramatic poet, bringing gradually to
firmness and maturity the dim broodings of his early years, till, in the
year 484, according to the marble already quoted, he was publicly
declared victor in that species of composition, of which, from the great
improvement he made in it, he was afterwards to be celebrated as the
father. In a few years after this, he, with his brother Ameinias,
performed a distinguished part at the battle of Salamis; and this
victory he eight years afterwards celebrated in his play of the
<span class="sc">Persians</span>, the earliest of his extant productions, of which the date is
certainly known.<sup><a href="#f_tl_03b" id="f_tl_03a">3</a></sup> The next mention that we find of the poet,
among the few stray and comparatively unimportant notices that remain,
is that some time between the year 478, that is, two years after the
battle of Salamis, and the year 467, he paid a visit to Sicily, and
along with Pindar, Bacchylides, Simonides, and other famous poets, was
hospitably entertained by Hieron the famous tyrant of Syracuse. The two
dates mentioned are those which mark the beginning and the end of the
reign of that ruler; within which period, of course, the visit to Sicily
must have taken place. Plutarch, in his life of Cimon (c. 8), connects
Æschylus&rsquo; departure for Sicily with the first tragic victory gained by
the young Sophocles in the year preceding the death of Hiero; but it is
possible that this precise date may have no other foundation than the
story which attributed the Sicilian journey of the elder bard to his
envy of the rising greatness of the younger; an instance of that sort of
impertinence in which small wits constantly indulge when they busy
themselves to assign motives for the actions of great ones. But the
precise period is of small moment. When in Sicily, we are told <span class="pagenum">{30}</span> that
Æschylus re-exhibited his play of the Persians,<sup><a href="#f_tl_04b" id="f_tl_04a">4</a></sup> and also wrote
a play called the <span class="sc">Aetneans</span>, to celebrate the foundation of the new
city of Etna by his patron. This event, we are informed by Diodorus (xi.
49), took place in the year 476, a date which would require the presence
of the poet in Sicily six years before the date mentioned by Plutarch.
Connected with Sicily, there is worthy of mention also, in a life of
Æschylus, the notable eruption of Etna, which took place in the year
479&mdash;the same in which the battle of Platæae took
place<sup><a href="#f_tl_05b" id="f_tl_05a">5</a></sup>&mdash;because there is a distinct allusion to this in the
Prometheus Bound (p. <a href="#pg192">192</a>), which enables us to say that this
famous drama could not have been written before the forty-seventh year
of the poet&rsquo;s life&mdash;that is to say, the full maturity of his powers. The
next date in the life of the poet, according to the recently discovered
διδασκαλία to the <span class="sc">Seven against Thebes</span>,<sup><a href="#f_tl_06b" id="f_tl_06a">6</a></sup> is the
representation of the great Oedipodean tetralogy in the year 467; and
the next date is a yet more important one, the year of the
representation of that famous trilogy, still extant, which has always
been looked on as his masterpiece. The argument of the <span class="sc">Agamemnon</span> fixes
the exhibition of the trilogy of which it is the first piece, to the
year of the archonship of Philocles, B.C. 458. It is known, also, that
the poet died at Gela, in Sicily, two years afterwards, in the
sixty-ninth year of his age, the date being given in the marble; and
there can be little doubt that the cause of this, his final retirement
to that island, must have been a growing distance between him and the
Athenian public, arising from diversity of political feeling, and the
state of parties in the Attic capital. In that city, democracy had been
in steady advance from the time of Cleisthenes (B.C. 509), and was now
ebullient under the popular inspiration of the recent Persian wars, and
glorified by the captainship of Pericles. The tendencies of the poet of
the Eumenides (as explained in the introduction to that play) were all
aristocratic; and it is in the highest degree probable that the
reception given by democratic spectators to his eulogy of the
aristocratic Court of the Areopagus, in the play just mentioned, may
have been such as to induce him to consult his own comfort, if not his
safety, by withdrawing altogether from a scene where his continual
presence might only tend to irritate those whom it could not alter.
</p>

<p>
After his death the Athenians testified their esteem for his character
by decreeing&mdash;what was quite an extraordinary privilege <span class="pagenum">{31}</span> according
to their stage practice&mdash;that his dramas might be exhibited at the great
Dionysiac festivals, when their author could be no longer a competitor
for the prize.<sup><a href="#f_tl_07b" id="f_tl_07a">7</a></sup> The people of Gela, justly proud that the bones
of so great a man should repose in their soil, erected a monument to his
memory with the following inscription:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">&ldquo;Here Æschylus lies, from his Athenian home</p>
<p class="i0">Remote, &rsquo;neath Gela&rsquo;s wheat-producing loam.</p>
<p class="i0">How brave in battle was Euphorion&rsquo;s son</p>
<p class="i0">The long-haired Mede can tell that fled from Marathon.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>
With regard to the great merits of Æschylus both as a poet and as the
creator of the tragic stage, there is but one testimony among the
writers of antiquity. He not only introduced, as we have elsewhere
stated, a second, and afterwards a third actor&mdash;without which there was
no scope for the proper representation of an action&mdash;but he made the
greatest improvements in the whole machinery and decorations of the
stage, gave dignity to the actors by a minute attention to their masks,
dresses, and buskins,<sup><a href="#f_tl_08b" id="f_tl_08a">8</a></sup> besides attending specially to the
graceful culture of the dance, according to the testimony of Athenæus
above quoted. As a dramatist he is distinguished by peculiar loftiness
of conception and grandeur of phraseology. His style is sometimes harsh
and abrupt, but it is always manly and vigorous; his metaphors are bold
and striking, with something at times almost oriental in their cast;
and, though not free from the offence of mixing incongruous
metaphors&mdash;the natural sin of an imagination at once fearless and
fertile&mdash;I do not think he can be fairly charged with turgidity and
bombast; for, as Aristophanes remarks, in the <span class="sc">Frogs</span>, there is a
superhuman grandeur about his characters which demands a more than
common elevation of phrase.<sup><a href="#f_tl_09b" id="f_tl_09a">9</a></sup> As to the obscurity with which he
has been charged, <span class="pagenum">{32}</span> the comparative clearness of those plays which
have been most frequently transcribed is a plain indication that this
fault proceeds more from the carelessness of stupid copyists, than from
confusion of thought or inadequate power of expression in the writer. In
some cases, as in the prophecy of Calchas in the opening scene of the
<span class="sc">Agamemnon</span>, the obscurity is studied and most appropriate. Poetry, like
painting, will have its shade. But the great excellence of Æschylus, as
a poet, is the bracing tone of thorough manhood, noble morality, and
profound piety which pervades his works. Among those who are celebrated
by Virgil as walking with Orpheus and Musæus in blissful Elysium&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Quique pii vates et Phoebo digna locuti,</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
the poet of the <span class="sc">Eumenides</span> deserves the first rank. There is a
tradition current, in various shapes, among the ancient writers that he
was brought before the Court of the Areopagus (so nobly eulogised by
himself), on the charge of impiety, but that he was acquitted. That the
Athenians might have taken offence at the freedom and boldness with
which he handled religious, as other topics, is possible, though
certainly by no means probable, considering how little of fixed doctrine
there was in their imaginative theology; but it is more like the truth,
according to the accounts which we have, that the offence which he gave
consisted in some purely accidental allusion occurring in one of his
plays, to some points that were, or seemed to be connected with the
awful Eleusinian mysteries.<sup><a href="#f_tl_10b" id="f_tl_10a">10</a></sup> Certain it is that no writer could
be less justly charged with impiety or irreligion. In his writings,
religion is the key-note; and the noblest moral sentiments spring
everywhere from the profoundest faith in a system of retribution carried
on by the various personages of the great celestial aristocracy, of
which Jove is the all-powerful and the all-wise head. So sublime,
indeed, is the Æschylean theology, that certain modern writers, as if
unwilling to think that such pure notions could co-exist with a belief
in the popular religion, have concluded that the poet, like Euripides
afterwards, must have been a free-thinker; and have imagined that they
have found sure indications to this effect in his writings. But, though
Æschylus was a Pythagorean (Cic. Tusc. II. 10), we have no proof that
the Pythagoreans, any more than their successors, the Platonists, were
given to scepticism. The seriousness of a poetic mind like that of
Æschylus is, at all times, naturally inclined to faith; and the
multiform <span class="pagenum">{33}</span> polytheism of the Greeks was as pliable in the hands of
pure men for pure purposes, as in the hands of gross men, to give a
delusive ideality to their grossness.<sup><a href="#f_tl_11b" id="f_tl_11a">11</a></sup>

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{37}</span></p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">Of</span> all that rich variety of Epic materials with which the early
minstrel-literature of Greece supplied the drama of a future age, there
was no more notable cycle among the ancients than that which went by the
popular name of Νόστοι, or the <i>Returns</i>; comprehending an account
of the adventures that befell the various Hellenic heroes of the Trojan
war in their return home. To this cycle, in its most general
acceptation, the Odyssey itself belongs; though the name of
Νόστοι, according to the traditions of the ancient grammarians, is
more properly confined to a legendary Epic, composed by an old poet,
Agias of Troezene, of which the return of Agamemnon and Menelaus forms
the principal subject. Of this Epos the grammarian Proclus<sup><a href="#f_aga_01b" id="f_aga_01a">f1</a></sup>
gives us the following abstract:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Athena raises a strife between Agamemnon and Menelaus concerning their
voyage homeward. Agamemnon remains behind, in order to pacify the wrath
of Athena; but Diomede and Nestor depart, and return in safety to their
own country. After them Menelaus sails, and arrives with five ships in
Egypt; the rest of his vessels having been lost in a storm. Meanwhile,
Calchas and Leonteus and Polypœtes go to Colophon, and celebrate the
funeral obsequies of Tiresias, who had died there. There is then
introduced the shade of Achilles appearing to Agamemnon, and warning him
of the dangers that he was about to encounter. Then follows a storm as
the fleet is passing the Capharean rocks, at the south promontory of
Eubœa, on which occasion the Locrian Ajax is destroyed by the wrath of
Athena, whom he had offended. Neoptolemus, on the other hand, under the
protection of Thetis, makes his way overland through Thrace (where he
encounters Ulysses in Maronea), to his native country, and proceeding to
the country of the Molossi, is there recognised by his grandfather, the
aged Peleus, the father of Achilles. The poem then concludes with an
account of the murder of Agamemnon by Ægisthus and Clytemnestra, of the
revenge taken on her by Orestes and Pylades, and of the return of
Menelaus to Lacedæmon.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#f_aga_02b" id="f_aga_02a">f2</a></sup>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{38}</span>
The last sentence of this curious notice contains the Epic germ of which
the famous trilogy&mdash;the Agamemnon, the Choephorœ, and the Eumenides of
Æschylus&mdash;present the
dramatic expansion. The celebrity of the legends with regard to the
return of the mighty Atridan arose naturally from the prominent
situation in which he stood as the admiral of the famous thousand-masted
fleet; and, besides, the passage from the old Troezenian minstrel just
quoted, is sufficiently attested by various passages&mdash;some of
considerable length&mdash;in the Odyssey, which will readily present
themselves to the memory of those who are familiar with the productions
of the great Ionic Epopœist. In the very opening of that poem, for
instance, occur the following remarkable lines:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">&ldquo;Strange, O strange, that mortal men immortal gods will still be blaming,</p>
<p class="i0">Saying that the source of evil lies with us; while they, in sooth,</p>
<p class="i0">More than Fate would have infatuate with sharp sorrows pierce themselves!</p>
<p class="i0">Thus even now Ægisthus, working sorrow more than Fate would have,</p>
<p class="i0">The Atridan&rsquo;s wife hath wedded, and himself returning slain,</p>
<p class="i0">Knowing well the steep destruction that awaits him; for ourselves</p>
<p class="i0">Sent the sharp-eyed Argus-slayer, Hermes, to proclaim our will,</p>
<p class="i0">That nor him he dare to murder, nor his wedded wife to woo.</p>
<p class="i0">Thus spoke Hermes well and wisely; but thy reckless wit, Ægisthus,</p>
<p class="i0">Moved he not; full richly therefore now thy folly&rsquo;s fine thou payest.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
And the same subject is reverted to in the Third Book (v. 194), where
old Nestor, in Pylos, gives an account to Telemachus, first of his own
safe return, and then of the fate of the other Greeks, so far as he
knew; and, again, in the Fourth Book (v. 535) where Menelaus is informed
of his brother&rsquo;s sad fate (slain &ldquo;like a bull in a stall&rdquo;) by the old
prophetic Proteus, the sea harlequin of the African coast; and, also, in
the Eleventh Book (v. 405), where Ulysses, in Hades, hears the sad
recital from the injured shade of the royal Atridan himself.
</p>

<p>
The tragic events by which Agamemnon and his family have acquired such a
celebrity in the epic and dramatic annals of Greece, are but the sequel
and consummation of a series of similar events commencing with the great
ancestor of the family; all which hang together in the chain of popular
tradition by the great moral principle so often enunciated in the course
of these dramas, that sin has always a tendency to propagate its like,
and a root of bitterness once planted in a family, will grow up and
branch out luxuriantly, till, in the fulness of time, it bears those
bloody blossoms, and fruits of perdition that are its natural product.
The guilty ancestor, in the present case, is the <span class="pagenum">{39}</span> well-known
Tantalus, the peculiar style of whose punishment in the infernal regions
has been stereotyped, for the modern memory, in the shape of one of the
most common and most expressive words in the English language. Tantalus,
a son of Jove, a native of Sipylos in Phrygia, and who had been admitted
to the table of the gods, thinking it a small matter to know the divine
counsels, if he did not, at the same time, gratify his vanity by making
a public parade of his knowledge before profane ears, was punished in
the pit of Tartarus by those tortures of ever reborn and never gratified
desire which every schoolboy knows. His son, Pelops, an exile from his
native country, comes with great wealth to Pisa; and having, by
stratagem, won, in a chariot race, Hippodamia, the daughter of
Oernomaus, king of that place, himself succeeded to the kingdom, and
became so famous, according to the legend, as to lend a new name to the
southern peninsula of Greece which was the theatre of his
exploits.<sup><a href="#f_aga_03b" id="f_aga_03a">f3</a></sup> In his career also, however, the traces of blood
are not wanting, which soil so darkly the path of his no less famous
descendants. Pelops slew Myrtilus, the charioteer by whose aid he had
won the race that was the beginning of his greatness; and it was the
Fury of this Myrtilus&mdash;or &ldquo;his blood crying to Heaven,&rdquo; as in Christian
style we should express it&mdash;that, according to one poet (Eurip. Orest.
981), gave rise to the terrible retributions of blood by which the
history of the Pelopidan family is marked. Of Pelops, according to the
common account, Atreus and Thyestes were the sons. These having murdered
their stepbrother, Chrysippus, were obliged to flee for safety to
Mycenæ, in Argolis, where, in the course of events, they afterwards
established themselves, and became famous for their wealth and for their
crimes. The bloody story of these hostile brothers commences with the
seduction, by Thyestes, of Aerope, the wife of Atreus; in revenge for
which insult, Atreus recalls his banished brother, and, pretending
reconciliation, offers that horrid feast of human flesh&mdash;the blood of
the children to the lips of the father&mdash;from which the sun turned away
his face in horror. The effect of this deed of blood was to entail,
between the two families of Thyestes and Atreus, a hereditary hostility,
the fruits of which appeared afterwards in the person of Ægisthus, the
son of the former, who is found, in this first play of the trilogy,
engaged with Clytemnestra in a treacherous plot to avenge his father&rsquo;s
wrongs, by the murder of his uncle&rsquo;s son.
</p>

<p>
Agamemnon, the son, or, according to a less common account (for which
see Schol. ad Iliad II. 249), the grandson of Atreus, being <span class="pagenum">{40}</span>
distinguished above the other Hellenic princes for wealth and power, was
either by special election appointed, or by that sort of irregular
kingship common among half-civilized nations, allowed to conduct the
famous expedition against Troy that in early times foreshadowed the
conquests of Alexander the Great, and the influence of the Greek
language and letters in the East. Such a distant expedition as this,
like the crusades in the middle ages, was not only a natural living Epos
in itself, but would necessarily give rise to that intense glow of
popular sympathy, and that excited state of the popular imagination,
which enable the wandering poets of the people to make the best poetic
use of the various dramatic incidents that the realities of a highly
potentiated history present. Accordingly we find, in the very outset of
the expedition, the fleet, storm-bound in the harbour of Aulis, opposite
Eubœa, enabled to pursue its course, under good omens, only by the
sacrifice of the fairest daughter of the chief. This event&mdash;a sad
memorial of the barbarous practice of human sacrifice, even among the
polished Greeks&mdash;formed the subject of a special play, perhaps a
trilogic series of plays,<sup><a href="#f_aga_04b" id="f_aga_04a">f4</a></sup> by Æschylus. This performance,
however, has been unfortunately lost; and we can only imagine what it
may have been by the description in the opening chorus of the present
play, and by the beautiful, though certainly far from Æschylean,
tragedy of Euripides. For our present purpose, it is sufficient to note
that, in the Agamemnon, special reference is made to the sacrifice of
Iphigenia, both as an unrighteous deed on the part of the father, for
which some retribution was naturally to be expected, and as the origin
of a special grudge in the mind of the mother, which she afterwards
gratifies by the murder of her husband.
</p>

<p>
As to that deed of blood itself, and its special adaptation for dramatic
purposes, there can be no doubt; as little that Æschylus has used his
materials in the present play in a fashion that satisfies the highest
demands both of lyric and dramatic poetry, as executed by the first
masters of both. The calm majesty and modest dignity of the much-tried
monarch; the cool self-possession, and the smooth front of specious
politeness that mark the character of the royal murderess: the
obstreperous bullying of the cowardly braggart, who does the deed with
his heart, not with his hand; the half-wild, half-tender ravings of the
horror-haunted Trojan prophetess; these together contain a combination
of highly wrought dramatic elements, <span class="pagenum">{41}</span> such as is scarcely excelled
even in the all-embracing pages of our own Shakespere. As far removed
from common-place are the lyrical&mdash;in Æschylus never the
secondary&mdash;elements of the piece. The sublime outbreak of Cassandra&rsquo;s
prophetic horror is, as the case demanded, made to exhibit itself as
much under the lyric as in the declamatory form; while the other choral
parts, remarkable for length and variety, are marked not only by that
mighty power of intense moral feeling which is so peculiarly Æschylean,
but by the pictorial beauty and dramatic reality that distinguish the
workmanship of a great lyric master from that of the vulgar dealer in
inflated sentiment and sonorous sentences.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{95}</span></p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">The</span> right of the avenger of blood, so familiar to us from its prominency
in the Mosaic Law (see Numbers, chap. 35), is a moral phenomenon which
belongs to a savage or semi-civilized state of society in all times and
places; and appears everywhere with the most distinct outline in the
rich records of the early age of Greece, which we possess in the Homeric
poems. No doubt, the most glowing intensity, and the passionate
exaggeration of the feeling, from which this right springs, is found
only among the hot children of the Arabian desert;<sup><a href="#f_cho_01b" id="f_cho_01a">f1</a></sup> and in no
point of his various enactments were the wisdom and the humanity of
their great Jewish lawgiver more conspicuous than in the appointment of
sacerdotal cities of refuge, which set certain intelligible bounds of
space and time to the otherwise interminable prosecution of family
feuds, and the gratification of private revenge. But the great traits of
the system of private revenge for manslaughter, stand out clearly in the
Iliad and Odyssey; and the whole of the ancient heroic mythology of
Greece is full of adventures and strange chances that grew out of this
germ. Out of many, I shall mention only the following instance. In the
twenty-third book of the Iliad (v. 82), when the shade of Patroclus
appears at the head of his sorrowful, sleeping friend, after urging the
necessity of instant funeral, for the peace of his soul, he proceeds to
make a further request, as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">&ldquo;This request I make, this strict injunction I on thee would lay,</p>
<p class="i0">Not apart from thine Achilles, place thy dear Patroclus&rsquo; bones;</p>
<p class="i0">But together as, like brothers, in your father&rsquo;s house we grew,</p>
<p class="i0">Then when me, yet young, Menœtius from the Locrian Opus guiding,</p>
<p class="i0">To the halls of Peleus brought because that I had slain a man,</p>
<p class="i0">Even thy son, Amphidamas, whom unwittingly of life I reft</p>
<p class="i0">In a brainish moment, foolishly, when we quarrelled o&rsquo;er the dice;</p>
<p class="i0">Then the horseman, Peleus, kindly took me to his house, and kindly</p>
<p class="i0">Reared me with his son, and bade me be thy comrade to the end;</p>
<p class="i0">So my bones, when they are gathered, place where thine shall also be,</p>
<p class="i0">In the two-eared golden urn which gracious Thetis gave to thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
In these verses, we see the common practice of the heroic ages in
Greece, with regard to manslaughter. No matter how slight the occasion
might be out of which the lethal quarrel arose; how <span class="pagenum">{96}</span> innocent soever
of all hostile intention the unhappy offender; the only safety to him
from the private revenge of the kinsman of the person unwittingly slain,
was to flee to a country that acknowledged some foreign chief, and find
both a friend and a country in a distant land. All this, too, in an era
of civilization, when courts of law and regular judges (as from various
passages of Homer is apparent) were not altogether unknown; but nature
is stronger than law, and passion slow to yield up its fiery right of
summary revenge, for the cold, calculating retribution of an impartial
judge.
</p>

<p>
The person on whom the duty of avenging shed blood, according to the
heroic code of morals, fell, was the nearest of kin to the person whose
blood had been shed; and accordingly we find (as stated more at large by
Gesenius and Michaelis<sup><a href="#f_cho_02b" id="f_cho_02a">f2</a></sup>) that in the Hebrew language, the same
word means both an avenger of blood and a kinsman, while in the cognate
Arabic the term for an avenger means also a <i>survivor</i>&mdash;that is, the
surviving kinsman. In the same way, when Clytemnestra, as we have just
seen in the previous drama, had treacherously murdered her husband
Agamemnon, the code of social morality then existing laid the duty of
avenging this most unnatural deed on the nearest relation of the
murdered chieftain, viz.&mdash;his son, Orestes; a sore duty indeed, in this
case, as the principal offender was his own mother: so that in
vindicating one feeling of his filial nature the pious son had to do
violence to another; but a duty it still remained; and there does not
appear the slightest trace that it was considered one whit the less
imperative on account of the peculiar relation that existed here between
the dealer of the vengeful blow and the person on whom it was dealt.
<span class="sc">Whoso sheddeth man&rsquo;s blood by man shall his blood be shed</span> was the old
patriarchal law on the subject, proclaimed without limitation and
without exception; and the cry of innocent blood rose to Heaven with
peculiar emphasis when the sufferer was both a father and a king.
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">&ldquo;Good, how good, when one who dies unjustly leaves a son behind him</p>
<p class="i0">To avenge his death!&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Odyss</span>. iii. 196,</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
is the wisdom of old Nestor with regard to this subject and this very
case: and the wise goddess Athena, the daughter of the Supreme
Councillor, in whom &ldquo;all her father lives,&rdquo; stamps her distinct approval
on the deed of Orestes, by which Clytemnestra was murdered, and holds
him up as an illustrious example to Telemachus, by which his own conduct
was to be regulated in <span class="pagenum">{97}</span> reference to the insolent and unjust suitors
who were consuming his father&rsquo;s substance.
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">&ldquo;This when thou hast done, and well accomplished, as the need demands,</p>
<p class="i0">Then behoves thee in thy mind with counsel rife to ponder well</p>
<p class="i0">How the suitors that obscenely riot in thy father&rsquo;s halls</p>
<p class="i0">Thou by force or fraud may&rsquo;st slay: for surely now the years are come,</p>
<p class="i0">When too old thou art to trifle like a child with childish things.</p>
<p class="i0">Hast not heard what fair opinion the divine Orestes reaped</p>
<p class="i0">From the general voice consenting to the deed, then when he slew</p>
<p class="i0">The deceitful false Ægisthus, slayer of his famous sire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="right"><span class="sc">Odyssey</span> i. 293.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
Public opinion, therefore, to use a modern phrase, not only justified
Orestes in compassing the death of his mother, but imperatively called
on him to do so. Public opinion, however, could not control Nature, nor
save the unfortunate instrument of paternal retribution from that
revulsion of feeling which must necessarily ensue, when the hand of the
son is once red with the blood of her whose milk he had sucked. Orestes
finds himself torn in twain by two contrary instincts, the victim of two
antagonist rights. No sooner are the Furies of the father asleep, than
those of the mother awake; and thus the bloody catastrophe of the
present piece prepares the way for that tragic conflict of opposing
moral claims set forth with such power in the third piece of this
trilogy&mdash;the Eumenides.
</p>

<p>
The action of this play is the simplest possible, and will, for the most
part, explain itself sufficiently as it proceeds. Clytemnestra,
disturbed in conscience, and troubled by evil dreams, sends a chorus of
young women to offer libations at the tomb of Agamemnon, which, in the
present play, may fitly be conceived as occupying the centre of the
stage.<sup><a href="#f_cho_03b" id="f_cho_03a">f3</a></sup> These &ldquo;libation-bearers&rdquo; give the name to the piece. In
their pious function, Electra, the daughter of Agamemnon, joins; and as
she is engaged in the solemn rite, her brother Orestes (who had been
living as an exile in Phocis with Strophius, married to Anaxibia, the
sister of Agamemnon) suddenly arrives, and making himself known to his
sister, plans with her the murder of Ægisthus and Clytemnestra&mdash;which
is accordingly executed. Scarcely is this done, when the Furies of the
murdered mother appear, and commence that chase of the unhappy son from
land to land, which is ended in the next piece only by the eloquent
intercession of Apollo, and the deliberative wisdom of the blue-eyed
virgin-goddess of the Acropolis.
</p>

<p>
As a composition, the Choephoræ is decidedly inferior both to <span class="pagenum">{98}</span> the
Agamemnon which precedes, and the Eumenides which follows it; and the
poet, as if sensible of this weakness, following the approved tactics of
rhetoricians and warriors, has dexterously placed it in a position where
its deficiencies are least observed. At the same time, in passing a
critical judgment on this piece we must bear in mind two
things&mdash;<i>first</i>, that some parts of this play that appear languid,
long-drawn, and ineffective to us who read, may have been overflowing
with the richest emotional power in their living musical exhibition;
and, <i>secondly</i>, that many parts, especially of the choral chaunts, have
been so maimed and shattered by time that the modern commentator is
perhaps as much chargeable with the faults of the translation as the
ancient tragedian.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{133}</span></p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">Though</span> the ancient Greek religion, there can be no question, was too
much the creation of mere imagination, and tended rather to cultivate a
delicate sense of beauty than to strike the soul with a severe reverence
before the awful majesty of the moral law, yet it is no less certain
that to look upon it as altogether addressed to our sensuous emotions,
however convenient for a certain shallow school of theology, would lead
the calm inquirer after moral truth far away from the right track. As
among the gods that rule over the elements of the physical world, Jove,
according to the Homeric creed, asserts a high supremacy, which
restrains the liberty of the celestial aristocracy from running into
lawless licence and confusion; so the wild and wanton ebullitions of
human passion, over which a Bacchus, a Venus, and a Mars preside, are
not free from the constant control of a righteous Jove, and the sacred
terror of a retributive Erinnys. The great lesson of a moral government,
and a secret order of justice pervading the apparent confusion of the
system of things of which we are a part, is sufficiently obvious in the
whole structure of the two great Homeric poems; but if it exists in the
midst of that sunny luxuriance of popular fancy as a felt atmosphere, it
is planted by Æschylus, the thoughtful lyrist of a later age, on a
visible elevation, whence, as from a natural pulpit, enveloped with dark
clouds, or from a Heathen Sinai, involved in fearful thunders and
lightnings, it trumpets forth its warnings, and hurls its bolts of
flaming denunciation against Sin. The reader, who has gone through the
two preceding pieces of this remarkable trilogy, without discovering
this their deep moral significance, has read to little purpose; but it
is here, in the concluding piece, that the grand doctrine of the moral
government of the world is most formally enunciated; it is in the person
of the Furies that the wrathful indignation of Jove against the
violators of the moral law manifests itself, in the full panoply of
terror, and stands out as the stern Avatar of an inexorable Justice.
Here, therefore, if we will understand the moral seriousness, of which
the gay Hellenic Polytheism was not without its background, let us fix
our gaze. If the principles of &ldquo;immutable morality,&rdquo; of which our great
English Platonist talks so comprehensively, are to be found anywhere,
they are to be found here.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{134}</span></p>

<p>
The Furies (or the Εὐμενίδες, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>Gracious-minded</i>, as
they are called by a delicate euphemism) are generally looked upon as
the impersonations of an evil conscience, the incarnated scourges of
self-reproach. In this view there is no essential error; but it may be
beneficial, in entering on the perusal of the present piece, to place
before the modern reader more literally the true Homeric idea of these
awful Powers. In the Iliad and Odyssey, frequent mention is made of the
Erinnyes; and from the circumstances, in which their names occur, in
various passages of these poems, there can be no doubt that we are to
view them primarily as the impersonation of an imprecation or curse,
which a person, whose natural rights have been grossly violated,
pronounces on the person, by whom this violation comes.<sup><a href="#f_eum_01b" id="f_eum_01a">f1</a></sup> Thus
the father of Phoenix (Il. ix. 453), being offended by the conduct of
his son in relation to one of his concubines, &ldquo;loads him with frequent
curses, and invokes the hated Furies&rdquo;&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">Πολλὰ κατηρατο, στυγερὰς δ᾽ ἐπίκεκλετ Εριννΰς,</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
and &ldquo;the gods,&rdquo; it is added, &ldquo;gave accomplishment to his curse, the
subterranean Jove, and the awful Persephone.&rdquo; In the same book we find,
in the narration of the war, between the Curetes and the Ætolians,
about Calydon, how Althaea, the mother of Meleager, being offended with
her son on account of his having slain her brother, cursed him, and
invoked Pluto and Proserpine that he might die, and
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i7">Her the Fury that walketh in darkness,</p>
<p class="i0">Heard from Erebus&rsquo; depths, with a heart that knoweth no mercy.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
Both these instances relate to offences committed against the revered
character of a parent; but the elder brother also has his Erinnys.&mdash;(Il.
xv. 204), and even the houseless beggar&mdash;(Od. xvii. 575), and, more than
all, he to whose prejudice the sacred obligation of truth and honour
have been set at nought by the perjured swearer&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">Mighty Jove, be thou my witness, Jove of gods supremest, best,</p>
<p class="i0">Earth, and Sun, and Furies dread, that underneath the ground avenge</p>
<p class="i0">Whoso speaks and sweareth falsely&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
says Agamemnon&mdash;(Il. xix. 257)&mdash;in restoring the intact Briseis to
Achilles.
</p>

<p>
Thus, according to Homer&rsquo;s idea, wherever there is a cry of righteous
indignation, rising up to Heaven from the breast of an injured person,
there may be a Fury or Furies; for they are not <span class="pagenum">{135}</span> limited or defined
in any way as to number. It is not, however, on every petty occasion of
common offence that these dread ministers of divine vengeance appear.
Only, when deeds of a deeper darkness are done, do these daughters of
primeval Night (for so Æschylus symbolises their pedigree) issue forth
from their subterranean caverns. There is something volcanic in their
indignation, whose eruption is too terrible to be common. They chiefly
frequent the paths, that are dabbled with blood. A murdered father, or a
murdered mother especially, were never known to appeal to them in vain,
even though Jove&rsquo;s own prophet, Apollo, add his sanction to the deed. An
Orestes may not hope to escape the bloody chase, which the &ldquo;winged
hounds,&rdquo; invoked by a murdered Clytemnestra, are eager to prepare&mdash;the
sacred precincts of an oracular Delphi may not repel their
intrusion&mdash;the scent of blood &ldquo;laughs in their nostrils,&rdquo; and they will
not be cheated of their game. Only one greatest goddess, in whose hands
are the keys of her father&rsquo;s armoury of thunder, may withstand the full
rush of these vindictive powers. Only Pallas Athena, with her panoply of
Olympian strength, and her divine wisdom of reconciliation can bid them
be pacified.
</p>

<p>
In order to understand thoroughly the situation of the matricide
Orestes, in the present play, we must consider further the ancient
doctrine of pollution attaching to an act of murder, and the consequent
necessity of purification to the offender. The nature of this is
distinctly set forth by Orestes himself in a reply to his sister
Iphigenia, put into his mouth by Euripides. &ldquo;Loxias,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;first
sent me to Athens, and
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">There first arrived, no host would entertain me,</p>
<p class="i0">As being hated of the immortal gods,</p>
<p class="i0">And some, who pitied me, before me placed</p>
<p class="i0">Cold entertainment on a separate board;</p>
<p class="i0">Beneath the same roof though I lodged with them,</p>
<p class="i0">No interchange of living voice I knew,</p>
<p class="i0">But sat apart and ate my food alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="right"><span class="sc">Iphig. Taur</span>. 954.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Like an unclean leper among the Jews, the man polluted with human blood
wandered from land to land, as with a Cain&rsquo;s mark upon his brow, and
every fellow-being shrank from his touch as from a living plague.
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">&ldquo;For wisely thus our ancestors ordained,</p>
<p class="i0">That the blood-tainted man should know no joy</p>
<p class="i0">From sight of fellow-mortal or from touch,</p>
<p class="i0">But with an horrid sanctitude protected</p>
<p class="i0">Range the wide earth an exile.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="right"><span class="sc">Eurip. Orest</span>. 512.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">{136}</span></p>

<p class="noindent">
Under the ban of such a social excommunication as this, the first act of
readmission into the fraternity of human society was performed by the
sprinkling of swine&rsquo;s blood on the exile, a ceremony described
particularly in the following passage of Apollonius Rhodius, where Jason
and Medea are purified by Circe from the taint of the murder of
Absyrtus:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">&ldquo;First to free them from the taint of murder not to be recalled,</p>
<p class="i0">She above them stretched the suckling of a sow whose teats distilled</p>
<p class="i0">The juice that flows when birth is recent; this she cut across the throat,</p>
<p class="i0">And with the crimson blood outflowing dashed the tainted suppliants&rsquo; hands.</p>
<p class="i0">Then with other pure libations she allayed the harm, invoking</p>
<p class="i0">Jove that hears the supplication of the fugitive stained with blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="right"><span class="sc">Argon</span>. IV. 704-9.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
The other &ldquo;pure libations&rdquo; here mentioned include specially water, of
which particular mention is made in the legend of Alcmæon, which bears
a remarkable resemblance to that of Orestes, and in which it is in the
sacred stream of the Achelous alone that purification is at length
found, from the deeply-engrained guilt of matricide.&mdash;(Apollodor, Lib.
III., c. 7.) All this, however, availed only to remove the unhallowed
taint, with which human blood had defiled the murderer. It was
necessary, further, that he should be tried before a competent court,
and formally acquitted, as having performed every atonement and given
every satisfaction that the nature of the case required. According to
the consuetudinary law of Athens, there were various courts in which
different cases of murder and manslaughter were tried; but of all the
courts that held solemn judgment on shed blood, none was more venerable
in its origin, or more weighty in its authority, than the famous court
of the Areopagus; and here it is, accordingly, that, after being wearied
out by the sleepless chase of his relentless pursuers, Orestes, with the
advice and under the protection of Apollo, arrives to gain peace to his
soul by a final verdict of acquittal from the sage elders of Athens,
acting by the authority and with the direction of their wise
patron-goddess, Athena.
</p>

<p>
The connection of Athena and the Areopagus with the Orestean legend
gives to the present play a local interest and a patriotic hue of which
the want is too often felt in the existing remains of the Attic tragedy.
But Athena and the grave seniors of the hill of Ares are not the only
celestial personages here, in whom an Athenian audience would find a
living interest. The Furies themselves enjoyed a special reverence in
the capital of Athens, under the title of Σεμνὰι θεαι, or the
<i>dread goddesses</i>; and the principal seat of this worship, whether by a
happy conjunction or a wise choice, was situated on <span class="pagenum">{137}</span> the north-east
side (looking towards the Acropolis) of that very hill of the war god,
where the venerable court that bore his name held its solemn sessions on
those crimes, which it was the principal function of the Furies to
avenge. Up to the present hour, the curious traveller through the wreck
of Athenian grandeur sees pointed out the black rift of the rock into
which the awful virgins, after accepting the pacification of Athena, are
reported to have descended into their subterranean homes;<sup><a href="#f_eum_02b" id="f_eum_02a">f2</a></sup> and
it is with this very descent, amid flaming torch-light and solemn hymns,
that the great tragedian, mingling peace with fear, closes worthily the
train of startling superhuman terrors which this drama exhibits.
</p>

<p>
But Æschylus is not a patriot only, and a pious worshipper of his
country&rsquo;s gods in this play, he is also, to some small extent at least,
manifestly a politician. The main feature of the constitutional history
of Athens in the period immediately following the great Persian war, to
which period our trilogy belongs, was the enlargement and the systematic
completion of those democratic forms, of which the timocratic
legislation of Solon, about a century and a-half before, had planted the
first germs. Of these changes, Pericles, the man above all others who
knew both to understand and to control his age, was the chief promoter;
and in a policy whose main tendency was the substitution of a numerous
popular for a narrow professional control of public business, it could
not fail to be a main feature, that the authority of the judges of the
old aristocratic courts was curtailed in favour of those bodies of paid
jurymen, the institution of which is specially attributed to Pericles
and his coadjutor Ephialtes.<sup><a href="#f_eum_03b" id="f_eum_03a">f3</a></sup> Whether these changes were
politic or not, in the large sense of that word, need not be inquired
here; Mr. Grote has done much to lengthen the focus of those
short-sighted national spectacles, through which the English eye has
been accustomed to view the classic democracies; but let it be that
Pericles kept within the bounds of a wise liberty in giving a fair and a
large trial to the action of democratic principles at that time and
place; or let it be, on the other hand, that he overstepped the line
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">&ldquo;Which whoso passes, or who reaches not,</p>
<p class="i0">Misses the mark of right&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
in either case, where decision was so difficult, and discretion so
delicate, no one can accuse the thoughtful tragic poet of a stolid
conservatism, when he comes forward, in this play, as the advocate of
<span class="pagenum">{138}</span> the only court of high jurisdiction in Athens, now left unshaken
by the great surge of those popular billows, that were yet swelling
everywhere with the eager inspiration of Marathon and Salamis.<sup><a href="#f_eum_04b" id="f_eum_04a">f4</a></sup>
The court of Areopagus was not now, since the legislation of Solon, and
the further democratic movement of Cleisthenes, in any invidious or
exclusive sense an aristocratic assembly, such as the close corporations
of the old Roman aristocracy before the series of popular changes
introduced by Licinius Stolo; it was a council, in fact, altogether
without that family and hereditary element, in which the principal
offence of aristocracy has always lain; its members were composed
entirely (not recruited merely like our House of Lords) of those
superior magistrates&mdash;archons annually elected by the people&mdash;who had
retired from office. To magnify the authority of such a body, and
maintain intact the few privileges that had now been left it, was, when
an obvious opportunity offered, not only excusable in a great national
tragedian, but imperative. One thing his political attitude in this
matter certainly proves, that he was not a vulgar hunter after
popularity, delighting to swell to the point of insane exaggeration the
cry of the hour, but one of those men of high purpose, who prove a
greater strength of patriotism by stemming the popular stream, than by
swimming with it.
</p>

<p>
Besides the championship of the Court of the Areopagus, there is another
political element in this rich drama, which, though of less consequence,
must not be omitted. No sooner had the Persian invaders been fairly
driven back from the Hellenic shore, than that old spirit of narrow
local jealousy, which was the worm at the heart of Grecian political
existence, broke out with renewed vigour, and gave ominous indications
in the untoward affair of Tanagra, of that terrible collision which
shook the two great rival powers a few years afterwards in the famous
Peloponnesian war. Sparta and Athens, opposed as they were by race, by
geographical position, and by political character, after some public
attempts at co-operation, in which Cimon was the principal actor, shrunk
back, as in quiet preparation for the great trial of strength, into a
state of isolated antagonism. But, though open hostility was deferred,
wise precaution could not sleep; and, accordingly, we find the
Athenians, about this time, anxious to secure a base of operations, so
to speak, against Sparta in the Peloponnesus, by entering into an
alliance with Argos. As a genuine Athenian, Æschylus, whatever his
political feelings might be towards Cimon and the Spartan party, could
not but look with <span class="pagenum">{139}</span> pleasure on the additional strength which this
Argive connection gave to Athens in the general council of Greece; and,
accordingly, he dexterously takes advantage of the circumstance of
Orestes being an Argive, to trace back the now historical union of the
two countries to a period where Fancy is free to add what links she
pleases to the brittle bonds of international association.
</p>

<p>
Such is a rapid sketch of the principal religious and political
relations, some notion of which is necessary to enable the general
English reader to enter with sympathy on the perusal of the very
powerful and singular drama of the Eumenides. The professional student,
of course, will not content himself with what he finds here, but will
seek for complete satisfaction in the luminous pages of Thirlwall and
Grote&mdash;in the learned articles of Dr. Smith&rsquo;s Dictionary of Antiquities,
in the notes of Schoemann, and, above all, in the rare Dissertations of
Ottfried Müller, accompanying his edition of the Eumenides&mdash;a work
which I have read once and again with mingled admiration and
delight&mdash;from which I have necessarily drawn with no stinted hand in my
endeavours to comprehend the Orestean trilogy for myself, and to make it
comprehensible to others; and which I most earnestly recommend to all
classical students as a pattern-specimen of erudite architecture raised
by the hand of a master, from whom, even in his points of most baseless
speculation (as what German is without such?), more is to be learned
than from the triple-fanged certainties of vulgar commentators.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">In</span> the mythology of the ancient Greeks, as of many other nations, we
find the earlier periods characterised by a series of terrible mundane
struggles&mdash;wars in Heaven and wars on Earth&mdash;which serve as an
introduction to, and a preparation for the more regularly ordered and
more permanent dynasty that ultimately sways the sceptre of Olympus. In
the theological poem of Hesiod, as in the prose narration of
Apollodorus, <span class="sc">Heaven</span> and <span class="sc">Earth</span> are represented as the rulers of the
first celestial dynasty; their offspring, called Titans, in the person
of one of their number, <span class="sc">Kronos</span>, by a violent act of dethronement,
forms a second dynasty; while he, in his turn, after a no less violent
struggle, gives place to a third sceptre&mdash;viz., that of <span class="sc">Jove</span>&mdash;who, in
the faith of the orthodox Athenian, was the supreme ruler of the world
of gods, and men, now, after many throes and struggles, arrived, at its
normal state, not henceforward to be disturbed. The general character
which this succession of dynasties exhibits, is that of order arising
out of confusion, peace out of war, and wisely-reasoned plan triumphing
over brute force&mdash;

This representation of the philosophic lyrist of a late age is in
perfect harmony with the epithets μητιόεις and μητιέτα given to Jove by
the earliest Greek poets, and with the allegory by which Μῆτις, or
<i>Counsel</i> personified, is represented as one of the wives of the Supreme
Ruler. It is worthy of notice also, in the same view, that the legends
about the Titans, Giants, and other Earth-born monsters, warring with
Jove, are often attached to districts&mdash;such as Campania and Cilicia&mdash;in
which the signs of early volcanic action are, even at the present day,
unmistakeable; plainly indicating that such mythic narrations were only
exhibitions, in the historical form (according to the early style), of
great elemental convulsions and physical changes taking place on the
face of the Earth.

Among the persons most prominent in that primeval age of gigantic
&ldquo;world-strife&rdquo; (if we may be allowed to Anglicize a German compound)
stands Prometheus; not, however, like his Titan brethren in character,
though identical with them in descent, and in the position which he
finally assumed towards the god in whose hands the supreme government of
the world eventually remained. Prometheus, as his name denotes, strives
against the high authority of Jove, not by that &ldquo;reasonless force which
falls by its own weight,&rdquo; but by intelligence and cunning. Viewed in
this character, he was the natural ally, not of the serpent-footed
Giants and the flame-breathing Typhon, but of the All-wise Olympian; and
such, indeed, Æschylus, in the present piece (v. 219, <a href="#pg189">p. 189</a> below),
represents as having been his original position: but, as &ldquo;before honor
is humility, and before pride comes a fall,&rdquo; so the son of Iapetus, like
Tantalus, and so many others in the profoundly moral mythology of the
Hellenes, found himself exalted into the fellowship of the blissful
gods, only that he might be precipitated into a more terrible depth of
misery. He was wise; nay, benevolent (ἄκακητα, Hesiod. Theog.,
614); his delight was to exercise his high intellect in the elevation of
the infant human race, sunk in a state of almost brutish stupidity; he
stood forward as an incarnation of that practical intellect (so
triumphant in these latter days), which subjects the rude elements of
nature, for human use and convenience, to mechanical calculation and
control; but, with all this, he was proud, he was haughty; his Titanic
strength and his curious intellect he used, to shake himself free from
all dependence on the highest power, which the constitution of things
had ordered should stand as the strong key-stone of the whole. Not to
ruin mankind, but to save them, he sinned the sin of Lucifer; he would
make himself God; and, as in the eye of a court-martial, the subaltern
who usurps the functions of the commander-in-chief stands not acquitted,
because he alleges that he acted with a benevolent intent, or for the
public good, so, in the faith of an orthodox Athenian, Prometheus was
not the less worthy of his airy chains because he defied the will of
Jove in the championship of mankind. Neither man nor god may question or
impugn the divine decree of supreme Jove, on grounds of expediency or
propriety. With the will of Zeus, as with the laws of nature, there is
no arguing. In this relationship the first, second, and third point of
duty is submission. Such is the doctrine of modern Christian theology;
such, also, was the doctrine of the old Hellenic theologer, <span class="sc">Hesiod</span>&mdash;

Those who are acquainted with the philological learning on this subject,
which I have discussed elsewhere,<sup><a href="#f_pro_01b" id="f_pro_01a">f1</a></sup> or even with the common
ideas on the legend of Prometheus brought into circulation by the
productions of modern poetry, are aware that the view just given of the
moral significance of this weighty old myth, is not the current one, and
that we are rather accustomed to look upon Prometheus as a sort of
proto-martyr of liberty, bearing up with the strength of a god against
the punishment unjustly inflicted on him by the celestial usurper and
tyrant, Jove. But Hesiod, we have just seen, looks on the matter with
very different eyes; and the unquestioned supremacy of Jove that stands
out everywhere, from the otherwise not always consistent theological
system of the Iliad, leads plainly to the conclusion that Homer also,
had he had occasion to introduce this legend, would have handled it in a
spirit altogether different from our Shelleys and Byrons, and other
earth-shaking and heaven-scaling poets of the modern revolutionary
school. As little is there any ground (see the <a href="#tl">life of Æschylus</a>)
for the supposition that our tragedian has taken up different
theological ground in reference to this myth, from that which belonged
to the two great expositors of the popular creed; not to mention the
staring absurdity of the idea, that a grave tragic poet in a serious
composition, at a public religious festival, should have dared, or
daring, should have been allowed, to hold up their supreme deity to a
nation of freemen in the character of a cruel and unjust tyrant. Thrown
back, therefore, on the original Hesiodic conception of the myth, we are
led to observe that the imperfect and unsatisfactory ideas so current on
this subject in modern times, have taken their rise from the practice
(so natural under the circumstances) of looking on the extant piece as
a complete whole, whereas nothing is more certain than that it is only a
fragment; the second part, in fact, of a dramatic trilogy similar in
conception and execution to that, of which we have endeavoured to
present a reflection in the preceding pages. Potter, in his translation
published a hundred years ago, prefaced his version of the present piece
with the well-known fact, that Æschylus wrote three plays on this
subject&mdash;<i>the Fire-bringing Prometheus, the Prometheus Bound, and the
Prometheus Unbound</i>&mdash;this intimation <span class="pagenum">{180}</span> was not sufficient to prevent
his readers, with the usual hastiness of human logic, from judging of
what they saw, as if it were an organic whole, containing within itself
every element necessary for forming a true conception of its character.
The consequence was, that the hero of the piece, who, of course, tells
his own story in the most favourable way for himself, was considered as
having passed a final judgment on the case; as the friend and
representative of man, he naturally seemed entitled to the gratitude of
men; while Jove, being now only an idol in the world (perhaps a devil),
and having no advocate in the heart of the modern reader, was made to
stand&mdash;on the representation of the same Prometheus&mdash;as the type of
heartless tyranny, and the impersonation of absolute power combined with
absolute selfishness. This is Shelley&rsquo;s view; but that such was not the
view of Æschylus we may be assured, both from the consideration already
mentioned, and from the poet&rsquo;s method of reconciling apparently
incompatible claims of opposite celestial powers, so curiously exhibited
in the Eumenides. In the trilogy of the preceding pages, Orestes stands
in a situation, so far as the development of the plot is concerned,
precisely analogous to that of Prometheus in the present piece. His
conduct, as submitted to the moral judgment of the spectator, produces
the same conflict of contrary emotions of which his own bosom is the
victim. With the one-half of our heart we approve of his avenging his
father&rsquo;s murder; with the other half, we plead that a son shall, on no
ground of offence, allow his indignation to proceed so far as to imbrue
his hands in the blood of her whose milk he had sucked. This contrariety
of emotions excited in the second piece of the trilogy, produces the
tragic knot, which it is the business of the poet to unloose, by the
worthy interposition of a god. &ldquo;<i>Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice
nodus</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Exactly so in the second piece of the Promethean trilogy, our
moral judgment praises the benevolence of the god, who, to elevate our
human race from brutish degradation, dared to defy omnipotent power, and
to deceive the wisdom of the omniscient; while, at the same time, we
cannot but condemn the spirit of unreined independence that would shake
itself free from the great centre of moral cohesion, and the reckless
boldness that casts reproach in, the face of the great Ruler of the
universe. In this state of suspense, represented by the doubtful
attitude of the Chorus<sup><a href="#f_pro_02b" id="f_pro_02a">f2</a></sup> through the whole play, the present
fragment of the great Æschylean Promethiad leaves the well-instructed
modern reader; and it admits <span class="pagenum">{181}</span> not, in my view, of a doubt that, in
the concluding piece, it remained for the poet to effect a
reconciliation between the contending interests and clashing emotions,
somewhat after the fashion of which we possess a specimen in the
Eumenides. By what agency of individuals or of arguments this was done,
it is hopeless now to inquire; the fragmentary notices that remain are
too meagre to justify a scientific restoration of the lost drama; they
who wish to see what erudite imagination can do in this direction may
consult Welcker and Schoemann&mdash;<span class="sc">Welcker</span>, in the shape of prose
dissertation in his <i>Trilogie</i>, p. 28; and <span class="sc">Schoemann</span>, in the shape of
a poetical restoration of the lost poem, in the Appendix to his very
valuable edition of this play. About one thing only can we be certain,
that, in the ultimate settlement of disputed claims, neither will
Prometheus, on the one hand, be degraded from the high position on which
the poet has planted him as a sort of umpire between gods and men, nor
will Jove yield one whit of his supreme right to exact the bitterest
penalties from man or god who presumes to act independently of, and even
in opposition to his will. The tragic poet will duly exercise his grand
function of keeping the powers of the celestial world&mdash;as he does the
contending emotions of the human mind&mdash;in due equipoise and
subordination.<sup><a href="#f_pro_03b" id="f_pro_03a">f3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
The plot of the Prometheus Unbound is the simplest possible, being not
so much the dramatic progression of a course of events, as a single
dramatic situation presented through the whole piece under different
aspects. The theft of fire from Heaven, or (as the notice of Cicero
seems to indicate) from the Lemnian volcano of Mosychlos,<sup><a href="#f_pro_04b" id="f_pro_04a">f4</a></sup>
having been perpetrated in the previous piece, <span class="sc">Might</span> and <span class="sc">Force</span>, two
allegorical personages, the ministers of Jove&rsquo;s vengeance, are now
introduced, along with <span class="sc">Hephaestus</span>, the forger of celestial chains,
nailing the benevolent offender to a cold craggy rock in the wastes of
European Scythia. In this condition when, after a long silence, he at
length gives vent to his complaint, certain kindred divine
persons&mdash;first, the Oceanides, or daughters of Ocean, and then their
hoary sire himself, are brought on the scene, with words of solace and
friendly exhortation to the sufferer.<sup><a href="#f_pro_05b" id="f_pro_05a">f5</a></sup> When all the arguments
that these parties have to advance are exhausted in vain, another mythic
personage, of a different character, and for a <span class="pagenum">{182}</span> different purpose,
appears. This is Io, the daughter of Inachus, the primeval king of
Argos, who, having enjoyed the unblissful distinction of stirring the
heart of Jove with love, is, by the jealous wrath of Hera, transmuted
into the likeness of a cow<sup><a href="#f_pro_06b" id="f_pro_06a">f6</a></sup> and sent wandering to the ends of
the Earth, fretted into restless distraction by the stings of a
malignant insect. This character serves a threefold purpose. First, as a
sufferer, tracing the origin of all her misery from Jove, she both
sympathizes strongly with Prometheus, and exhibits the character of Jove
in another unfavourable aspect; secondly, with her wild maniac cries and
reinless fits of distraction, she presents a fine contrast to the calm
self-possession with which the stout-hearted Titan endures the penalty
of his pride; and, in the third place, as the progenitrix of the Argive
Hercules, the destined instrument of the delivery of Prometheus, she
connects the middle with the concluding piece of the trilogy. Last of
all, when this strange apparition has vanished, appears on the scene the
great Olympian negotiator, Hermes; who, with the eloquence peculiar to
himself, and the threatened terrors of his supreme master, endeavours to
break the pride and to bend the will of the lofty-minded offender. In
vain. The threatened terrors of the Thunderer now suddenly start into
reality; and, amid the roar of contending elements, the pealing Heaven
and the quaking Earth, the Jove-defying son of Iapetus descends into
Hell.
</p>

<p>
The superhuman grandeur and high tragic sublimity which belongs to the
very conception of this subject, has suffered nothing in respect of
treatment from the genius of the bard who dared to handle it. The
Prometheus Bound, though inferior in point of lyric richness and variety
to the Agamemnon, and though somewhat overloaded with narrative in one
place, is nevertheless felt throughout to be one of the most powerful
productions of one of the most powerful minds that the history of
literature knows. No work of a similar lofty character certainly has
ever been so extensively popular. The Prometheus Unbound of Shelley, and
Lord Byron&rsquo;s Manfred, bear ample witness, of which we may well be proud,
to the relationship which exists between the severe Melpomene of ancient
Greece, and the lofty British Muse.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{215}</span></p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">Danaus</span>, according to the received Greek story, was an Egyptian, who
founded a colony in Argos, at some date between the age of the oldest
Argive king Inachus, and the Trojan war. In the reality of this
sea-faring adventurer, modern historians, following the faith of the
ancient Greeks, have generally acquiesced, till, latterly, the Germans,
with that instinctive hostility to external tradition which
characterises them, have boldly ventured to explain both the Egyptian
and his colony away into a symbol, or an inanity. Of our most recent
writers, however, <span class="sc">Thirlwall</span>, after considering all the German
speculations on the subject, is not ashamed to say a word in favour of
the possibility or probability of an Egyptian colony in Argos;<sup><a href="#f_sup_01b" id="f_sup_01a">f1</a></sup>
while <span class="sc">Clinton</span><sup><a href="#f_sup_02b" id="f_sup_02a">f2</a></sup> (Introd. pp. 6, 7), boldly announces the
principle that &ldquo;we may acknowledge as real persons all those whom there
is no reason for rejecting. The presumption is in favour of the early
tradition. . . . Cadmus and Danaus appear to be real persons; for it is
conformable to the state of mankind, and perfectly credible that
Phœnician and Egyptian adventurers, in the ages to which these persons
are ascribed, should have found their way to the coasts of Greece.&rdquo;
<span class="sc">Grote</span>, however, seems to have acted most wisely in refusing to decide
whether any particular legend of the earliest times is mythical or
historical, on the ground that, though many of the legends doubtless
contain truth, they contain it only &ldquo;in a sort of chemical combination
with fiction, which we have no means of decomposing&rdquo;&mdash;(II. p. 50). This
play of Æschylus, therefore, cannot boast of any accessory historical
superadded to the principal poetic interest.
</p>

<p>
Danaus, the legend tells, though an Egyptian born, was not of Egyptian
descent. The original mother of his race was Io, daughter of Inachus,
king of Argos, and priestess of Hera in that place. How this
much-persecuted maid found her way from the banks of the &ldquo;Erasinus old&rdquo;
to the shores of the nurturing Nile, we have seen in the previous piece.
Danaus had a brother called Ægyptus, the father of fifty sons, as
himself was of fifty daughters. These fifty sons Ægyptus sought to
unite in wedlock to the equal-numbered progeny of his brother; but the
chaste maidens, whether because they actually thought it unholy (as it
certainly is, in the general case, unadvisable) for first cousins to
marry first cousins, or <span class="pagenum">{216}</span> because the suit was pressed in a manner
not the most respectful, or from a combination of both motives, refused
to enter into the bond; and, to escape the importunities of their
stronger male suitors, fled, under the guidance of their father, over
the seas to Greece. As kind chance, or, rather, Divine Providence, would
have it, they were wafted to that very part of Greece whence their
famous ancestress Io had originally proceeded, when the god-sent gadfly
drove her, in a career of tempestuous wanderings, through great part of
Europe and Asia, to Egypt. With their landing on this coast the present
opera commences; and the action which it represents is the very simple
one of the reception of the Libyan fugitives, by the Argive monarch
Pelasgus (otherwise called Gelanor), and their participation in the
rights and privileges of Argive citizenship. The transference of their
affections from Nile to Erasinus is solemnly sung in the concluding
chaunt. The Danaides are now Argives.
</p>

<p>
Considered by itself, the action of this piece is the most meagre that
can be conceived, and, as the poet has handled it, contains little that
can stir the deeper feelings of the heart, or strike the imagination
strongly. That the king of the Argives should feel serious doubts as to
the propriety of receiving such a band of foreigners into his kingdom,
formidable not in their own strength, indeed, but in respect of the
pursuing party, by whom they were claimed, was most natural; equally
natural, however, and, in a poetic point of view, necessary, that his
political fears should finally be outweighed by his benevolent regard
for the rights of unprotected virgins, and his pious fear of the wrath
of Jove, the protector of suppliants. The alternation of mind between
these contending feelings, till a final resolve is taken on the side of
the right, affords no field for the higher faculty of the dramatist to
display itself. As we have it, accordingly, the Suppliants is, perhaps,
the weakest performance of Æschylus. But the fact is, there is the best
reason to believe that the great father of tragedy never meant this
piece to stand alone, but wrote it merely to usher in the main action,
which followed in the other pieces of a trilogy; the names of which
pieces&mdash;Ἀιγύπτιοι, and Δαναίδες&mdash;are preserved in the list of the
author&rsquo;s pieces still extant. Of this, the whole conclusion of the
present piece, and especially the latter half of the last choral chaunt,
furnishes the most conclusive evidence.
</p>

<p>
The remainder of the story, which formed the main action of the trilogy,
is well known. Immediately after the reception of the fugitives, by the
Argives, their pursuers arrive, and land on the coast. This arrival is
announced in the last scene of the present piece. On <span class="pagenum">{217}</span> this, Danaus,
unwilling to lead his kind host into a war, pretends to yield to the
suit still as eagerly pressed, and the marriage is agreed on. But a
terrible revenge had been devised. At the very moment that he hands over
his unwilling but obedient daughters to the subjection of their hated
cousins, he gives them secret instructions to furnish themselves each
with a dagger, and, during the watches of the nuptial night, to dip the
steel in the throats of their unsuspecting lords. The bloody deed was
completed. Only one of all the fifty daughters, preferring the fame of
true womanhood to the claims of filial homage, spared her mate.
Hypermnestra saved her husband Lynceus. This conduct, of course, brought
the daughter into collision with her father and her father&rsquo;s family; and
one of those strifes of our mysterious moral nature was educed, which,
as we have seen in the trilogy of the Orestiad, it was one great purpose
of the Æschylean drama to reconcile. If the murder occupied the second
piece, as the progress of the story naturally brings with it, a third
piece, according to the analogy of the Eumenides, would be necessary to
bring about the reconciliation, and effect that purifying of the
passions which Aristotle points out as the great moral result of tragic
composition. That Aphrodite was the great celestial agent employed in
the finale of the Suppliants, as Pallas Athena is in the Furies, has
been well divined; a beautiful fragment in celebration of love, and in
favour of Hypermnestra remains; but to attempt a reconstruction of these
lost pieces at the present day, though an amusement of which the learned
Germans are fond, is foreign to the habits of the British mind. Those
who feel inclined to see what ingenuity may achieve in this region, are
referred to Welcker&rsquo;s Trilogie, and Gruppe&rsquo;s Ariadne.
</p>

<p>
The moral tone and character of this piece is in the highest degree
pleasing and satisfactory. The Supreme Jove, whose prominent attribute
is power, here receives a glorification as the protector of the
persecuted, and the refuge of the distressed. On the duty of
hospitality, under the sanction of Ζεύς ξένιος and ἱκεσιος, as
practised among the ancient Greeks, I refer the reader with pleasure
to Grote&rsquo;s History of Greece, Vol. II., p. 114.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The scene,&rdquo; says Potter, &ldquo;is near the shore, in an open grove, close to
the altar and images of the gods presiding over the sacred games, with a
view of the sea and ships of Egyptus on one side, and of the town of
Argos on the other, with hills, and woods, and vales, a river flowing
between them: all, together with the persons of the drama, forming a
picture that would have well employed the united pencils of Poussin and
Claude.&rdquo;
</p>

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{257}</span></p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">One</span> of the most indisputable laws of the moral world, and, when
seriously considered, perhaps the most awful one, is that principle of
hereditary dependence, which connects the sins of one generation, and
often of one individual, by an indissoluble bond, with the fortunes of
another. In the closely compacted machinery of the moral world no man
can be ignorant, or foolish, or vicious to himself. The most isolated
individual by the very act of his existence, as he necessarily inhales,
so he likewise exhales, a social atmosphere, either healthy so far, or
so far unhealthy, for the race. Nothing in the world is independent
either of what co-exists with it, or of what precedes it. The present,
in particular, is everywhere at once the child of the past, and the
parent of the future. It is no doubt true that a foolish father does not
always beget a foolish son. There are counteracting influences
constantly at work to prevent the fatal tendency to degeneration, of
which Horace speaks so feelingly&mdash;

</div>

<p class="noindent">
but the &ldquo;<span class="sc">Delicta majorum immeritus lues</span>&rdquo; of the same poet remains a
fearful reality in the daily administration of the world, which no
serious-thinking man can afford to disregard. In the ancient law of
Moses, as in the most famous systems of Christian theology, this
principle plays a prominent part; and awful as its operation is, often
sweeping whole generations into ruin, and smiting whole nations with a
chronic leprosy, for the folly or extravagance of an ephemeral
individual, we shall not be surprised to find it equally conspicuous in
the literature of so subtle a people as the Greeks. The Hellenic mind,
no doubt, was too sunny and too healthy to allow itself to be encased
and imprisoned with this idea, as with an iron mail; but as a mysterious
dark background of moral existence it was recognised in its highest
power; and nowhere so distinctly, and with such terrible iteration, as
in those lyrical exhibitions of solemn, religious, and legendary faith,
which we call tragedy.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{258}</span></p>

<p>
Among the other serious ethico-religious legends with which the scanty
remains of the rich Greek tragedy have made us more familiar, the dark
fates of two famous families&mdash;the Pelopidae and the Labdacidae&mdash;force
themselves upon our attention with a marked distinctness. How the evil
genius (ἀλάστωρ) of inherited guilt revealed itself in the
blood-stained track of the descendants of Tantalus we have seen on the
large scale of a complete trilogy; the play to which
we now introduce the reader is an exhibition of the same stern law of
moral concatenation, in one of the scenes of the dark story of the
Theban family of the Labdacidae. Labdacus, the father of this
unfortunate race, is traced back in the legendary genealogy to the
famous Phœnician settler, Cadmus, being removed from him by only one
generation.<sup><a href="#f_sat_01b" id="f_sat_01a">f1</a></sup> This head of the family appears tainted with no
moral guilt of an extraordinary kind; but his son Laius figures in the
legend, not like Pelops in the Pelopidan story, as a murderer, but as a
licentious and a lustful character. Yielding to the violent impulses of
unnatural passion,<sup><a href="#f_sat_02b" id="f_sat_02a">f2</a></sup> he is said to have carried off from Elis,
Chrysippus, the son of Pelops; whereupon the injured father pronounced
against the unholy ravisher the appropriate curse that he should die
childless, or, if he did beget children, that himself should lose his
life by the hands of those to whom he had been the means of giving it.
We see here exemplified that grand principle of retaliation (<i>lex
talionis</i>), &ldquo;<i>An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth</i>,&rdquo; which stands
out so prominently in the laws of Moses, and is so agreeable to the
moral instincts of the human heart. Laius was to perish by his own
progeny, because, in the irregular gratification of the procreative
instinct, he had sinned against Nature. The curse spoken against him by
Pelops was the wrathful expression of one of Nature&rsquo;s greatest laws; in
whatever way we seek violently to obtain happiness contrary to the sober
course of the divine arrangements, in that way we are sure with our own
hands to work our own destruction. This is inevitable. Accordingly, that
the direct sanction of the gods might be added to the utterance of an
aggrieved human heart, the legend represents the lustful offender as
consulting the oracle of Delphi, whether he might not with safety
disregard the imprecation of Pelops, and beget children by his wife
Iocaste (called Epicaste in Homer, Od. XI. 271); and receiving the
ominous answer&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0">Sow not the seed of children, in despite</p>
<p class="i0">Of the gods: for if thou shalt beget a son,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">{259}</span></p>
<p class="i0">Him who begat shall the begotten slay,</p>
<p class="i0">And all thy house in bloody ruin perish.<sup><a href="#f_sat_03b" id="f_sat_03a">f3</a></sup></p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
But the divine oracle, as was to have been expected from the character
of the questioner, was given in vain. Laius had consulted the oracle not
that he might know and obey the divine will, but that he might, if
possible, escape from the terrible consequences of the curse of Pelops,
and yet gratify his natural desire of having offspring. The result was
natural. In a moment of forgetfulness, induced by the free use of that
mother of many evils, wine, he neglected the divine warning; and, from
his fatal embrace, a child was born, destined in the course of the
accomplishment of the ancient curse, both to suffer many monstrous
misfortunes in his own person, and to transmit guilt and misery to
another generation. This child was Oedipus,<sup><a href="#f_sat_04b" id="f_sat_04a">f4</a></sup> so named from the
piercing of his feet by nails, and subsequent exposure on Mount
Cithaeron, a device contrived by his father, in order to escape the
fulfilment of the divine oracle. But it is not possible, as Homer
frequently inculcates, to deceive the mind of the gods. The helpless
infant, the child of destiny, is found (like Romulus), by some
shepherds, and by them taken to Polybus king of Corinth. Here the
foundling is brought up as the son of that monarch; but, on one
occasion, being taunted by some of his youthful comrades with the
reproach that he is not really the son of Polybus, but a fatherless
foundling, he goes forth to the oracle of Delphi, and to the wide world,
to clear up what had been more wisely left in the dark; and here his
god-sent misfortunes overtake him, and the evil genius of his father
drives the innocent son blindfold into inevitable woe. The Pythoness,
according to her wont, returned an answer more doubtful than the
question. Oedipus was told not who his father was, but that a dark
destiny hung over him, to kill his father, and to commit incest with his
mother. Knowing no parents but those whom he had left at Corinth, he
proceeded on his wanderings, in a direction the opposite of that by
which he had come; and, on the road between Delphi and Daulis,<sup><a href="#f_sat_05b" id="f_sat_05a">f5</a></sup>
met a person of consequence, with a charioteer and an attendant, in a
car. The charioteer immediately ordered the foot traveller, somewhat
insolently, after the manner of aristocratic satellites, to get out of
the way; which rudeness the hot youth resenting, a scuffle ensued, in
which the charioteer <span class="pagenum">{260}</span> and his master were slain, while the
attendant fled. The murdered prince was Laius; and Oedipus, unwittingly,
nay, doing everything he could to elude the fate, had slain his own
father. But the ancient Fury, for a season, concealed her vengeance, and
allowed a brief glory to be shed round her victim, that he might
thereafter be plunged in more terrible darkness. The Sphynx, a monstrous
creature, of Egyptian birth, half virgin, half lion, had been sent by
wrathful Mars, to desolate the Theban country, devouring, with her
bloody jaws, whosoever could not solve her famous riddle. When
depopulation proceeded at a fearful rate from this cause, the Thebans
promised Iocaste, the widow of Laius, and queen of the country, in
marriage, to him who should succeed in explaining the enigma. Oedipus
was successful; and, becoming king of Thebes, was married, in ignorance,
to his own mother. Thus the net of destiny was drawn closer and closer
round its victim; but the hour of doom was not yet come. Joined in this
unnatural wedlock, the unfortunate son of Laius became the father of two
sons, Eteocles and Polynices, and of two daughters, Antigone and Ismene.
Circumstances (which Sophocles narrates in his Oedipus Tyrannus)
afterwards bringing the story of Oedipus&rsquo; life and the nature of his
connection with Iocaste to light, the unfortunate old king looking upon
himself as an object of hatred to the gods, and unworthy to look upon
the day, tore out his eyes, and was confined by his sons&mdash;whether from
cruelty or superstition&mdash;in a separate house, and treated otherwise in a
manner that appeared to him disrespectful and unkind.<sup><a href="#f_sat_06b" id="f_sat_06a">f6</a></sup> Enraged
at this treatment, he pronounced an imprecation against them, that they
should one day <span class="sc">divide their inherited land by steel</span>; whereupon they,
to render any hostile collision impossible, made an agreement to
exercise kingly authority over the whole Theban territory, each for a
year at a time, while the other should leave the country. Eteocles, as
the elder, reigned first; but when the appointed term came round, like
other holders of power, he showed himself loath to quit; and Polynices,
fleeing to Argos, sought assistance from Adrastus, king of that country.
This prince, along with the Ætolian Tydeus, the father of Diomede, and
other chiefs, marched against Thebes with a great armament, in order to
force Eteocles to yield the yearly tenure of the throne to his brother,
according to agreement. The appearance of this armament before the gates
of the Cadmean city, and its sad issue, in the death, by their own <span class="pagenum">{261}</span>
hands, of the two hostile brothers, form the subject of the present
play.
</p>

<p>
From this rapid sketch, the reader will see plainly that the dismal
story of Laius and Oedipus, and his children, affords materials for a
whole series of tragedies; and that, in fact, &ldquo;<span class="sc">The Seven against
Thebes</span>&rdquo; is only one of the last acts of a great consecutive legendary
history, of which each part is necessary to explain the other. This
close connection of the subjects naturally suggests the question,
whether our play, as we now have it, stood alone in dramatic
representation, or whether it was not only a subordinate part of a
large dramatic whole. We know for
certain that Æschylus wrote at least four plays, besides the present,
of which the materials were taken from the cycle of this Theban
legend&mdash;namely, <span class="sc">Laius</span>, <span class="sc">Oedipus</span>, <span class="sc">The Sphynx</span>, and the
<span class="sc">Eleusinians</span>;<sup><a href="#f_sat_07b" id="f_sat_07a">f7</a></sup> and it has been not unplausibly conjectured
that some of his other plays, of which the names are preserved, belong
to the same series.<sup><a href="#f_sat_08b" id="f_sat_08a">f8</a></sup> In what precise connection, however, the
existing play stood to any of the rest in actual representation, there
were, till very recently, no satisfactory means of judging; and
accordingly no scanty wealth of erudite speculation (after the German
fashion), made to look like science, was spent upon the subject. Now, at
length it has been announced, that the διδασκαλία, containing
the actual order of representation of four of these plays, has been
discovered;<sup><a href="#f_sat_09b" id="f_sat_09a">f9</a></sup> and, if the document be genuine, we are enabled to
assert that, in the 78th Olympiad, Æschylus gained the tragic prize
with the tetralogy, of <span class="sc">Laius</span>, <span class="sc">Oedipus</span>, <span class="sc">The Seven against Thebes</span>,
and the <span class="sc">Sphynx</span>, a satiric drama.
</p>

<p>
With regard to the merits of the present piece, while its structure
exhibits, in the most striking manner, the deficient skill of the early
dramatists, its spirit is everywhere manly and noble, and instinct with
the soul of the warlike actions which it describes. The best parts are
epic, not dramatic&mdash;namely, those in which the Messenger describes the
different characters and appearance of the seven chiefs posted each at a
separate gate of the Cadmean city. The drama concludes with a Theban
coronach or wail over the dead bodies of the self-slain brothers; for
the proper relishing of which, the imaginative reproduction of some
appropriate music is indispensable. The introduction after this of the
Herald, announcing the decree of the Theban senate, whereby burial is
denied to the body of Polynices, <span class="pagenum">{262}</span> and the heroic display of
sisterly affection on the part of Antigone, are&mdash;if this really was the
last piece of a trilogy&mdash;altogether foreign both to the action and to
the tone of the tragedy, and must be regarded as a blunder. If Schiller,
and even Shakespere, on occasions, could err in such matters, much more
Æschylus.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">{297}</span></p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">The</span> piece, on the perusal of which the reader is now about to enter,
stands unique among the extant remains of the ancient drama, as drawing
its materials from the historical, not the mythological, age of the
Greek people. We are not, from this fact, to conclude that the Greeks,
or the ancients generally, drew a more strict boundary line between the
provinces of history and poetry, than the moderns. Such an inference
were the very reverse of the fact, as the whole style of ancient history
on the one hand, and the examples of Ennius and Lucan in poetry,
sufficiently show. Not even within the special domain of the Greek stage
is our one extant example the only historical drama of which the records
of Hellenic literature have preserved the memory; on the contrary, one
of the old arguments of the present play expressly testifies that
Phrynichus, a contemporary of Æschylus, had written a play on the same
subject; and we know, from other sources, that the same dramatist had
exhibited on the stage, with the most powerful effect, the capture of
the city of Miletus, which took place only a few years before the battle
of Marathon.<sup><a href="#f_per_01b" id="f_per_01a">f1</a></sup> There was a plain reason, however, why, with all
this, historical subjects should, in the general case, have been
excluded from the range of the Greek dramatic poetry; and that reason
was, the religious character which, as we have previously shown,
belonged so essentially to the tragic exhibitions of the Hellenes. That
religious character necessarily directed the eye of the tragic poet to
those ages in the history of his country, when the gods held more
familiar and open converse with men, and to those exploits which were
performed by Jove-descended heroes in olden time, under the express
sanction, and with the special inspiration, of Heaven. Had a
characteristically Christian drama arisen, at an early period, out of
the festal celebrations of the Church, the sacred poets of such a drama
would, in the same way, have confined themselves to strictly scriptural
themes, or to themes belonging to the earlier and more venerable
traditions of the Church.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{298}</span>
With regard to the subject of the present drama, there can be no doubt
that, like the fall of Napoleon at Moscow, Leipzig, and Waterloo, in
these latter days, so in ancient history there is no event more suited
for the purposes of poetry than the expedition of Xerxes into Greece.
There is &ldquo;a beginning, a middle, and an end,&rdquo; in this story, which might
satisfy the critical demands of the sternest Aristotle; a moral also,
than which no sermon ever preached from Greek stage or Christian pulpit
is better calculated to tame the foolish pride, and to purify the turbid
passions of humanity. In ancient and modern times, accordingly, from
Chœrilus to Glover, the whole, or part of this subject has been
treated, as its importance seemed to demand, epically;<sup><a href="#f_per_02b" id="f_per_02a">f2</a></sup> but of
all the poetical glorifications of this high theme, that of Æschylus
has alone succeeded in asserting for itself a permanent niche in the
library of that select poetry which belongs to all times and all places.
</p>

<p>
Of the battle of Salamis and the expedition of Xerxes, as an historical
event, it must be unnecessary for me to say a single word here,
entitled, as I am, to presume that no reader of the plays of Æschylus
can be ignorant of the main facts, and the tremendous moral significance
of that event. I shall only mention, for the sake of those whose memory
is not well exercised in chronology, that it took place in the autumn of
the year 480 before Christ, ten years after the battle of Marathon,
thirty years after the expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome, and eighty
years after the foundation of the great Persian empire by Cyrus the
great. Those who wish to read the descriptions of the poet with complete
interest and satisfaction should peruse the 38th, 39th, 40th, and 41st
chapters (Vol. V.), of Mr. <span class="sc">Grote</span>&rsquo;s great work; and, if possible, also,
the 7th and 8th books of Herodotus.<sup><a href="#f_per_03b" id="f_per_03a">f3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
On the poetical merit of the Persians, as a work of art, a great
authority, Schlegel, has pronounced that it is &ldquo;undoubtedly the most
imperfect of all the extant tragedies of this poet;&rdquo; but, unless the
historical theme be the stumbling-block, I really cannot see on what
ground this judgment proceeds. As for the descriptive parts, the battle
of Salamis, and the retreat of the routed monarch, are pictured with a
vividness and a power to which nothing in this massive and manly author
is superior; the interest to the reader being increased tenfold by the
fact, that he is here dealing with a real event of the most important
character, and recited by one of the best qualified <span class="pagenum">{299}</span> of
eye-witnesses. The moral of the piece, as already stated, is, in every
respect, what in a great drama or epos could be desired; and, with
respect to the lyrics, the Anapæstic march, and the choral chaunt in
Ionic measure, with which it opens, has about it a breadth, a
magnificence, and a solemnity surpassed only in the choral hymns of the
Agamemnon. Not less effective, to an ancient audience, I am sure, must
have been the grand antiphonal chaunt with which (as in The Seven
against Thebes) the variously repeated wail of this tragedy is brought
to a climax; and if the Bishop of London, and some other scholars, have
thought this sad exhibition of national lamentation ridiculous, we ought
to believe that these critics have forgot the difference between a
modern reader and an ancient spectator, rather than that so great a
master as Æschylus did not know how to distinguish between a tragedy
and a farce.
</p>

<p>
In common with other historical poems, the Persians of Æschylus is not
altogether free from the fault of bringing our imaginative faculty into
collision with our understanding, by a partial suppression or
exaggeration of historical truth. In the way of suppression, the most
noticeable thing is, that the slave of Themistocles, who is described as
having, by a false report to Xerxes, brought on the battle of Salamis,
appears, according to the poet, to have cheated the Persians only;
whereas, according to the real story, he cheated his countrymen also,
and forced them to fight in that place against the will of the
non-Athenian members of the confederation. In the way of exaggeration,
again, <span class="sc">Grote</span>, in an able note,<sup><a href="#f_per_04b" id="f_per_04a">f4</a></sup> has shown what appear to me
valid reasons for disbelieving the fact of the freezing of the Strymon,
and its sudden thaw, described so piteously by our poet; while the very
nature of the case plainly shows that the whole circumstances of the
retreat, coming to us through Greek reporters, were very liable to
exaggeration. This, however, in a poetical description, is a small
matter. What appears to me much worse, and, indeed, the weakest point in
the structure of the whole drama, is that the contrast between the
character and conduct of Darius and that of his son is drawn in colours
much too strong; the fact being that the son, in following the advice of
Mardonius to attack Athens, was only carrying into execution the design
of the father, and making use of his preparations.<sup><a href="#f_per_05b" id="f_per_05a">f5</a></sup> All that I
have to say in defence of this misrepresentation is, that the poet wrote
with a glowing patriotic heat what we now contemplate with a cold
historical criticism. The greatest works of the greatest masters can, as
<span class="pagenum">{300}</span> human nature is constituted, seldom be altogether free from
inconsistencies of this kind.
</p>

<p>
I have only further to add, that I have carefully read what <span class="sc">Welcker</span>
and <span class="sc">Gruppe</span><sup><a href="#f_per_06b" id="f_per_06a">f6</a></sup> have written on the supposed ideal connection
between the four pieces of the tetralogy, among which the Persians
stands second, in the extant Greek argument;<sup><a href="#f_per_07b" id="f_per_07a">f7</a></sup> but that, while I
admire exceedingly the learning and ingenuity of these writers, I doubt
much the utility of attempting to restore the palaces of ancient art out
of those few loose bricks which Time has spared us from the once compact
mass. Poetry may be benefited by such speculations; Philology, I rather
fear, has been injured.

<p class="i0">Each man prepared his supper, and the sailors</p>

<p class="i0">Then, when the sun his shining glory paled,</p>

<p class="i0">They might not use their strength, and, jammed together,</p>

word the appearance of γ to a careless scrutinizer; and that this blunder
was actually made the metre proves in Eumen. 361, in which passage,
whatever <span class="sc">Sew</span>. may ingeniously force into it, the meaning <i>from above</i>
is that which is most in harmony with the context. Besides, in such

That the divine vengeance for evil deeds comes not immediately, but

theology as it is familiar to the Heathen dramatists. Therefore,
Tiresias, in the Antigone, prophesies to Creon that &ldquo;the avenging
spirits of Hades and of Heaven, storing up mischief for a future day
(ὑστεροφθόροι), would punish him for his crimes. But when the sword
of Olympian justice is once drawn, then the execution of the divine

After the above sublime introduction follows the Invocation of Jove, as
the supreme over-ruling Deity, who alone, by his infinite power and
wisdom, is able to lead the believing worshipper through the intricacies
of a seemingly <span class="pagenum">{339}</span> perplexed Providence. The passage is one of the
finest in ancient poetry, and deserves to be specially considered by
theological students. The reader will note carefully the reverential awe
with which the Chorus names the god invoked&mdash;a feeling quite akin to
that anxiety which takes possession of inexperienced people when they
are called on to address written or spoken words to persons of high
rank. Many instances of this kind are quoted from the ancients by
<span class="sc">Victorius</span>, in <span class="sc">Stanley</span>&rsquo;s notes, by <span class="sc">Sym</span>., and by <span class="sc">Peile</span>. The most

If in so obvious a matter a profound mythologist like Welcker&mdash;(Tril.,

of free-thinking and irony, we have only another instance of the
tyrannous power of a favourite idea to draw facts from their natural
cohesion, that they may circle round the nucleus of an artificial
crystallization. Sewell has also taken up the same idea with regard to
the scepticism of this passage; and in him, no less, must we attribute
this notion to the influence of a general theory with regard to the
religious opinions of Æschylus, rather than to any criticism which the

though <span class="sc">Fr</span>. says, with a reference to Bernhardy, that βρότοις may be

he admits that the sense given in my version, and in all the modern

with the following sentence I do not understand.

the poet has put it, as some palliation of her own contemplated deed,
into the mouth of Clytemnestra, but in perfect conformity also with the
Homeric theology, which supposes that suffering must always imply guilt.

by a reference to the familiar example in Epist. Tit. I. 12, that with
the ancients the characters of poet and prophet were confounded in a
way that belongs not at all to our modern usage of the same words.
Epimenides of Crete, in fact, to whom the Apostle Paul alludes, was not
only a prophet, but also a physician, like Apollo (ἱατρόμαντις, Eumen.
v. 62). In the same way the Hebrew word <i>Nabah</i>, prophetess, is applied
to Miriam, Exod. xv. 20; and it may well be, that Æschylus, in the true
spirit of these old times, and also following the deep religious
inspiration of his Muse, alludes here to a character more sacred than
the Homeric ἀοιδὸς, <i>Minstrel</i> or <i>Bard</i>, and this distinction should,
of course, be preserved in the translation. <span class="sc">Sew</span>. with great happiness,
in my opinion, has given &ldquo;the bards of fate;&rdquo; but it were useless to
press any such nice matter in this passage, especially when we call to
mind the high estimation in which the Homeric ἀοιδὸς stands in the
Odyss., and the remarkable passage, III. 267, where a minstrel is
represented as appointed by Agamemnon to counsel and control Clytemnestra

cannot refer to Menelaus, because he has not yet been mentioned, can
have little weight in the present chorus, in the first antistrophe of
which Paris is first alluded to, by dim indications, and afterwards
distinctly by name. This method of merely hinting at a person, before
naming him, is common in all poetry, but peculiarly characteristic of
Æschylus. Besides, it is impossible to deny that the πόθος in the next
line refers to Menelaus, and can refer to no other. <span class="sc">Con</span>., who refers

intention and to the moral tone of the piece, to paint the fair fugitive
with such an engaging look of reluctance to leave her husband; on the
contrary, he blames her in the strongest language, ἄτλητα τλᾶσα, and
represents her as leaving Argos with all the hurry of a common elopement,
where both parties are equally willing for the amorous flight, ῎Βέβακε
ρίμφα διὰ πυλᾶν. After which our fancy has nothing to do but imagine her
giving her sails to the wind as swiftly as possible, and bounding gaily
over the broad back of ocean with her gay paramour. In this connection,
to say &ldquo;<i>she</i> <span class="sc">stands</span>,&rdquo; appears quite out of place. In my view of this

but the passages which the latter adduce are not to the point. The
Greeks do not attribute any governing virtue to the eyes of the gods,
further than this, that the immortal beings who are supposed to govern
human affairs must see, and take cognizance of them. Jupiter&rsquo;s eye may
glare like lightning, but the real lightning is always hurled from his

<p>
The spear (δόρυ) is with the Greeks the regular emblem of war, as
the sword is with us; so a famous warrior in Homer is δουρικλυτὸς, a
famous <span class="pagenum">{346}</span> spearman, and a warrior generally ἀιχμητὴς. Further, as
in the heroic or semi-civilized age, authority presents itself, not
under the form of law and peaceful order, so much as under that of force
and war, the spear comes to be a general emblem of authority; so in the
present passage. St. Paul&rsquo;s language, Rom. xiii. 4, <i>the magistrate
weareth not the sword</i> (μάχαιραν) <i>in vain</i>, gives the modern
counterpart of the Æschylean phraseology.

This passage, in the original, boils with a series of high-sounding
words, δυσκύμαντα, κεροτοπούμεναι, ὀμβροκτύπῳ, extremely characteristic
both of the general genius of the poet and the special subject of poetic
description. I have endeavoured, according to the best of my ability,

would refer the reader to the able versions of <span class="sc">Sym</span>. and <span class="sc">Med</span>., which

the whole tempest, as <span class="sc">Sym</span>. makes it, or to a part of it (στρόβος) as
in my version, there can be no doubt, I think, that here ποιμὴν can mean
nothing but &ldquo;pilot,&rdquo; as in the Persian ποιμάνωρ means a commander. There
can be no objection to retaining the word &ldquo;shepherd,&rdquo; but I do not like

In a passage hopelessly corrupt, and where no two editors agree in the

with a certain degree of looseness from the text of the MSS. as given by
<span class="pagenum" id="pg349">{349}</span> <span class="sc">Well</span>. Through this text, broken and disjointed as it is, the
meaning glimmers with a light sufficient to guide the reader, who wishes
only to arrive at the idea, without aspiring at the reconstitution of
the lost grammatical form of the text; and it is a satisfaction to think
that all the translators, from <span class="sc">Pot</span>. to <span class="sc">Con</span>., however they may vary
in single phrases, give substantially the same idea, and in a great
measure the same phrase. This idea, a most important one in the Greek
system of morals, is well expressed by <span class="sc">Sym</span>. in his note on this
place&mdash;&ldquo;The Chorus here moralizes and dwells on the consequences to
succeeding generations of the crimes of their predecessors. He traces,
as it were, a moral succession, handed down from father to son, where
one transgression begets another as its inevitable result. The first
parent stock was &lsquo;ὕβρις&rsquo; a spirit of insolence or insubordination,
breaking out into acts of outrage, the forerunner of every calamity in a
Grecian republic, against which the philosophers and tragedians largely
declaimed. They denounced it as well from a principle of policy as a
sentiment of religion. In short, the poet treats here of the moral
concatenation of cause and effect, the consequence to the descendants of
their progenitors&rsquo; misconduct, operating either by the force of example
or of hereditary disposition, which in the mind of the Chorus produces
the effect of an irresistible fatality.&rdquo;&mdash;I may mention that I have
retained the original word δάιμων in its English form &ldquo;demon,&rdquo;
this being, according to my feeling, one of the few places where the one
can be used for the other without substituting a modern, and, therefore,
a false idea.

and, on the other hand, I cannot think with <span class="sc">Sym</span>. that the expression

are many phrases in Æschylus that, if translated literally, sound very

Speaking of the era of the great Doric migration with regard to Megara,
Bishop <span class="sc">Thirlwall</span> (Hist. Greece, c. VII.) writes as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Megara
itself was, at this time, only one, though probably the principal, among
five little townships which were independent of each other, and were not
unfrequently engaged in hostilities, which, however, were so mitigated
and regulated by local usage as to present rather the image than the
reality of war. They were never allowed to interrupt the labours of the
husbandman. The captive taken in these feuds was entertained as a guest
in his enemy&rsquo;s house, and when his ransom was fixed, was dismissed
before it was paid. If he discharged his debt of honour he became, under
a peculiar name (δορύξενος), the friend of his host; a breach of the
compact dishonoured him for life both among the strangers and his
neighbours&mdash;a picture of society which we could scarcely believe to have
been drawn from life, if it did not agree with other institutions which
we find described upon the best authority as prevailing at the same
period in other parts of Greece.&rdquo;

<p>
In this Antistrophe, and the preceding Strophe, there is one of those
plays on the name of the god addressed, which appear inappropriate to
us, <span class="pagenum">{352}</span> but were meant earnestly enough by the ancients, accustomed to
deal with an original language from which the significancy of proper
names had not been rubbed away.&mdash;See <a href="#n_pro_08b">note</a> on Prometheus, v. 85. Besides
this, there was naturally a peculiar significancy attached to the names
of the gods.&mdash;See <a href="#n_aga_018b">note 18</a>, <a href="#pg338">p. 338</a>, above. In the present passage the
first pun is on the name Απόλλων, Apollo, and the verb ἀπόλλυμι, which
signifies to <i>destroy</i>) so the Hebrew <span class="sc">Abaddon</span> from <span class="sc">Abad</span>, he
<i>perished</i>.&mdash;Apoc. ix. 11), a function of the Sun god familiar enough to
the Greek mind, from the description of the pestilence in the opening
scene of the Iliad. The second pun is on the title ἀγυιεὺς, leader, or
way-god, concerning which see previous note. I have here, as in the case
of Helen and Prometheus (v. 85), taken the simple plan of explaining the
epithet in the text. The translator who will not do this must either,
like <span class="sc">Con</span>. and <span class="sc">Sym</span>., leave the play on the words altogether
imperceptible to the English reader, or, like <span class="sc">Sew</span>., be driven to the
necessity of inventing a new pun, which may not always be happy English,

This translation is free, because it did not occur to me that the
laconism of the Greek, if literally translated, would be sufficiently
intelligible. I have no doubt as to the correctness of this version of
a passage which is certainly not a little puzzling at first sight. Two
phases of human life are spoken of in the previous lines; one is the
change from prosperity to adversity, the other, from adversity down to
utter ruin and death. The preference expressed in the line καὶ ταῦτ
ἒκέινων κ.τ.λ. can refer to nothing but these two. So <span class="sc">Peile</span> and
<span class="sc">Con</span>.; and there is a terrible darkness of despair about Cassandra&rsquo;s
whole tone and manner, which renders this account of human life
peculiarly natural in her parting words.

Most lame and impotent conclusion!&mdash;so the reader has no doubt been all
the while exclaiming. Our great poet has here contrived to make one of
the most tragic moments of the play consummately ridiculous; and it is
in vain to defend him. No doubt, old men are apt enough to be
irresolute, and to deliberate, while the decisive moment for action
slips through their fingers. So far in character. But why does the poet
bring this vacillation so laboriously forward, that it necessarily
appears ludicrous? This formal argumentation turns the character of the
Chorus into caricature. Nor will it do to say with <span class="sc">Con</span>. that this
impotent scene was &ldquo;forced on Æschylus, by the fact of the existence of
a Chorus, and the nature of the work he had to do.&rdquo; A short lyrical ode
might have covered worthily that irresolution, which a formal
argumentation only exposes. No one blames the Chorus for doing nothing;
that is all right enough; but every one must blame the poet for making
them talk with such a show of solemn gravity and earnest loyalty about
doing nothing.

about the matter appears from this, that in the place where <span class="sc">Blom</span>. and
<span class="sc">Peile</span> suppose an immense <i>lacuna</i>, the sense in the mouth of
Clytemnestra νῦν δ᾽ ὤρθωσας runs on with a continuous allusion to the
preceding words of the Chorus. For which reason I have not hinted the
existence of an omission, nor is it at all likely that the reader has
lost much. These are matters which belonged to the ancient symmetrical
arrangement of the Chorus before the eyes and ears of the spectators,
and which I much fear it it impossible for us, readers of a dry MS., to
revive at this time of day.

I am afraid I stand alone, among the translators, in translating δαῖμον
in this and similar places, by the English word <i>god</i>; but persuaded as
I am that the English words <i>Fiend</i> and <i>Demon</i> are steeped in modern
partly Gothic, partly Christian associations of a character essentially
opposed to the character and genius of the Greek theology, I choose
rather to offend the taste than to confound the judgment of my reader in
so important a matter. The Greeks habitually attributed to their <i>gods</i>
actions and sentiments, which we attribute only to devils and demons.
Such beings (in the English sense) were, in fact, altogether unknown to
the Greeks. Their gods, as occasion required, performed all the
functions of our Devil; so that, to use a familiar illustration, instead
of the phrase, <i>what the devil are you about?</i> so familiar to a genuine
English ear, the Athenians would have said, <i>what the god are you
about?</i> Hence the use of δαιμόνιε in Homer.

Along with <span class="sc">Sym</span>. and <span class="sc">Con</span>. I retain the Greek word here, partly from
the reason given in the previous note with regard to δαίμων, partly
because the word is familiar to many poetical ears from Shelley&rsquo;s
poetry, partly, also, because I take care so to explain it in the
context, that it cannot be misunderstood by the English reader. The
Greek word ἀλάστωρ means an <i>evil genius</i>. Clement of Alexandria, in a
passage quoted by <span class="sc">Sym</span>. (Protrept c. II.) classes the Alastors of the
ancient tragedy with the Furies and other terrible ministers of heaven&rsquo;s
avenging justice. About the etymology of the word the lexicographers
and critics are not agreed. Would there be any harm in connecting it
with ἀλαστέω (Il. XII. 163), and ἐπαλαστέω (Odys. I. 252), so that it
should signify <i>an angry or wrathful spirit</i>.

Jove was regarded as the grand source of the power exercised by all the

I am quite at a loss to explain the original of this passage further
than that I see nothing harsh (as <span class="sc">Lin</span>. does) in referring the general
term δυσφρόνων to the Furies, who are specially mentioned afterwards.
It is quite common with Æschylus to give a general description first,
and then specialise; and, moreover, in the present instance the
λιχήνος which the δυσφρονες are to send on the flesh of the sinner,
are strictly analogous to the λιχὴν ἀφυλλος (Eumen. v. 788), with
which, in the Eumenides, they threaten to curse the Athenian soil. For
the rest I should have little objection, in the present state of the
MSS., to adopt <span class="sc">Lobeck</span>&rsquo;s suggestion, μηνίματα, into the text, and

The old Jewish maxim of <i>an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth</i>,
will here recur to every one; and, indeed, it is, to the present day, an
instinctive dictate of social justice, however insufficient it may be as
a general motive for individual conduct. In this spirit, wise old
Nestor, in the Iliad (II. 354), considers that it would be disgraceful
for the Greeks to think of returning home &ldquo;before some Greek had slept
with the wife of some Trojan,&rdquo; as a retaliation for the woes that Paris
had inflicted on Greek social life, in the matter of Helen. In Dante&rsquo;s
Inferno there are many instances, sometimes ingenious, sometimes only
ridiculous, of the application of this principle to retributive
punishment in a future life.

The student will find a very remarkable difference between this version
and that in <span class="sc">Pot</span>. and E. P. Oxon., arising from the conversion of the
word πολεμιστρίας into ἰηλεμιστρίας, a conjectural emendation which we
owe to <span class="sc">Hermann</span> and <span class="sc">Ahrens</span>, and which appears to me to be one of the
most satisfactory that has ever been made on the text of Æschylus. It

chorus of &ldquo;the Persians;&rdquo; which will be the best commentary on the
exaggerated tone of the present passage. I have followed the recent

We are not always sufficiently alive to the deep moral power which lay
concealed beneath the harlequin dress of the old Greek Polytheism. What
Æschylus puts into the mouth of a theatrical chorus in sounding rhythm,
Xenophon, in plain prose, teaches from the mouth of a Greek captain
thus&mdash;&ldquo;Whosoever violates an oath to which the gods are witness, him I
can never be brought to look on as a happy man. For, when the gods are
once hostile, no one can escape their anger&mdash;not by hiding himself in
darkness&mdash;not by fencing himself within a strong place. For all things
are subject to the gods.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Anab</i>. II. 5. Think on some of the Psalms!

the cell of a god; but the rubbish is so thick, and the excavations so
meagre, that perfect recovery of the original scheme is in some places
impossible, and restoration in a great measure conjectural. Under these

the most accurate translation is sure to be the worst. In the metre, I

&rsquo;Tis a misfortune, arising from having such a body as a Chorus always on
the stage, that they are often found to be spectators, where they cannot
be partakers of a great work; and thus their attitude as secret
sympathisers, afraid to show their real sentiments, becomes on many
occasions the very reverse of heroic. This strikes us moderns very
strongly, apt as we are, from previous associations, to take the Chorus
along with the other characters of the play, and judge it accordingly;
but to the Greeks, who felt that the Chorus was there only for the
purpose of singing, criticisms of this kind were not likely to occur.

and so in a thousand places of the poet. To the spectator, however, in
the theatre, spiritual beings must be visible, because (as Müller,
Eumen. 3, properly remarks) they are the very persons from before whose
eyes it is the business of the poet to remove the veil that interposes
between our everyday life and the spiritual world. That the Furies of
the following piece were seen bodily at this part of the present play,
and are not supposed to exist merely in the brain of Orestes, is only
what a decent regard for common poetical consistency on the part of a
great tragic poet seems to imply.

What god is not said, but the word θεός is used indefinitely without
the article. The Greeks had an indefinite style when talking of the
divine providence&mdash;<i>a god</i>, or <i>some god</i>, or <i>the god</i>, or <i>the
gods</i>&mdash;a style which arose naturally out of the Polytheistic form of
celestial government. Examples of all the different kinds of phraseology
are frequent in Homer. Sometimes, in that author, the expression, though
indefinite in itself, has a special allusion, plain enough from the
context; and in the present passage I see no harm in supposing an
allusion to Apollo, under whose immediate patronage Orestes acts through
the whole of this piece and that which follows.

<p class="right">&ldquo;Old earth, primeval prophetess, I first</p>
<p class="i0">With these my prayers invoke; and Themis next.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Earth, or <span class="sc">Gaea</span>, as the Greeks name her, is described here, and in
Pausanias (X. 5), as the most ancient prophetess of Delphi, for two
reasons; <i>first</i>, because out of the earth came those intoxicating fumes
or vapours, by the inspiration of which the oracles were given forth
(see Diodorus XVI. 26); <i>second</i>, because, as <span class="sc">Schoemann</span> well observes,
<span class="sc">Gaea</span>, as the aboriginal divine mother, out of whose womb all the
future celestial genealogies were developed, necessarily contained in
herself the law of their development, and is accordingly represented by
Hesiod as exercising a prophetic power with regard to the fates of the
other gods.&mdash;(Theog. 463, 494, 625). The same writer remarks with equal
ingenuity and truth, that Themis, her successor in the prophetic office,
is only a personification of that law of development which, by necessity
of her divine nature, originally lay in Gaea; and I would remark,
further, how admirable the instinct was of those old mythologists, who
placed <span class="sc">Love</span> and <span class="sc">Right</span>, and other ineradicable feelings or notions of
the human mind, among the very oldest of the gods. It is notable also,
that previous to Apollo, all the presidents of prophecy at
Delphi&mdash;including the famous Phemonoe, not mentioned here but by
Pausanias l. c., were women, and even Loxias himself could not give forth
oracles without the help of a Pythoness. There is a great fitness in
this, as women are naturally both more pious and more emotional than
men. Hence their peculiar fitness for exercising prophetic functions, of
which ancient Germany was witness&mdash;(see Cæsar B.C. I. 50).

There can be no question that <span class="sc">Schütz</span> was right in translating λίμνη,

Müller and Schoemann concur; and it appears to me sufficiently
reasonable. There is no reason, however, for not receiving, along with
this explanation, another which has been given, that the sons of the
fire-god mean &ldquo;smiths.&rdquo; Artificers of this kind were necessary to
pioneer the path for the procession of the god in the manner here

&rsquo;Tis plain from the whole language of Homer, both in the Iliad and

The reading προνάια (or προνᾴα), which I translate, is that of <span class="sc">Well</span>.

Phalaris, which has been stoutly defended by Hermann, in his remarks on
Müller&rsquo;s Eumenides (Opusc. VI. v. 2, p. 17). This, however, in the face
of an express passage of Herodotus (I. 92), as <span class="sc">Pal</span>. well observes, has
been done rashly; and now <span class="sc">Fr</span>. and <span class="sc">Schoe</span>. bring forward inscriptions
which prove that there is not the slightest cause for tampering with the

otherwise than from the account of them by Müller in the Anhang, p. 14;
but, taken at their highest value, they seem only to prove that a
vagueness had taken hold of the ancients themselves in respect to the
designation of this temple, not certainly that Æschylus and Herodotus
both made a mistake in calling it προνᾴα, or that all the transcribers

may be seen in <span class="sc">Stan</span>. The Scholiast to Euripides Phœnissai (v. 227,

The connection of the god of the waters with Delphi is given by

all high mountains necessarily produce copious streams of water of
which, no less than of the waves of ocean, Poseidon is lord.

human iniquity from Hades, that he might descend again, and report to
the Infernal powers. His garb was as follows&mdash;a dun-coloured tunic
(χιτων) reaching down to the feet, girt with a crimson sash; on his
head an Arcadian cap, with the twelve signs of the Zodiac inwoven;
tragic buskins, a very long beard, and an ashen rod in his hand.&rdquo;&mdash;VI.

<span class="sc">Chorus</span>. Whether Hermann in his &ldquo;<i>Dissertatio de Choro Eumenidum</i>&rdquo;
(Leipzig, 1816) was the first that directed special attention to the
peculiar character of this Chorus as indicated by the Scholiast, I do
not know (Wellauer says so, and I presume he knew). Certain it is that
<span class="sc">Pot</span>., by neglecting this indication, has lost a great deal of the
dramatic effect of this part of the tragedy. The style of the chorus is
decidedly fitful and exclamatory throughout, and must have formed a
beautiful contrast to the steady stability of the solemn hymn that
follows, beginning, &ldquo;<i>Mother night that bore me</i>.&rdquo; As to the particular
distribution of the parts of this chorus, that is a matter on which, as
<span class="sc">Schoe</span>. remarks, no two critics are likely to agree; nor is minute
accuracy in this respect, even if it were attainable, a matter of any
importance to the dramatic effect of the composition as now read. The
only thing to be taken care of is, that we do not blend in a false
continuity what was evidently spoken fitfully, and by different
speakers, with a sort of <i>staccato</i> movement, as the musicians express
it. This is <span class="sc">Pot</span>.&rsquo;s grand error, not only here, but in many other of
the choral parts of our poet; and, in this view, some of Hermann&rsquo;s
remarks (Opusc. VI. 2, 38) on Müller&rsquo;s division are perfectly just. As
for myself, by distributing the parts of the chorus among three voices,
I mean nothing more than that these parts were likely spoken by separate
voices. Scholefield and Dyer&rsquo;s view (Classical Museum, Vol. I. p. 281),
that there were three principal Furies prominent above the rest in this
piece, is not improbable, but admits of no proof. In my versification I
have endeavoured to imitate the rapid Dochmiacs of the original.

The idea of a succession of celestial dynasties proceeding on a system
of &ldquo;development,&rdquo; as a certain class of modern philosophers are fond to
express it, is characteristic of the Greek mythology.&mdash;(See <a href="#pg047">p. 47</a> above,
Antistrophe I.) The Furies, according to all the genealogies given of
them, were more ancient gods than Apollo, with whom they are here
brought, into collision. Our poet, as we shall see in the opening
invocation of the first grand choral hymn of this piece, makes them the
daughters of most ancient <span class="sc">Night</span>, who, according to the Theogony (v.
123), proceeded immediately from the aboriginal <span class="sc">Chaos</span>. Hesiod himself
makes the Erinyes, along with the giants, to be produced from the blood
of Uranus, when his genitals were cut off by Kronos (Theog. 185); a
genealogy, by the way, quite in consistency with the Homeric
representation given in the Introductory Remarks, of the origin of the
Furies from the curses uttered by injured persons, worthy of special
veneration, on those by whom their sacrosanct character had been
violated.

I have not the slightest doubt that τίθησιν (ο)ρθὸν πόδα in this

if so, τίθησι κατηρεφῆ πόδα can only mean to <i>sit</i>, &ldquo;the feet being

<span class="sc">Choral Hymn</span>. &ldquo;This sublime hymn is of a character, in some respects,
kindred to the καταδέσεις, or incantations of antiquity, which were
directed to Hermes, the Earth, and other infernal Deities for the
purpose of <i>binding down</i> certain hated persons to destruction. For this
reason it is called ὕμνος δέσμιος. This character is specially
indicated by the refrain or burden, which occurs in the first pair of
Strophes; such repetitions containing the emphatic words of the
incantation being common in all magical odes. So in Theocritus (Idyll.
2), we have constantly repeated, &lsquo;<i>Iungx, bring me the man, the man whom
I mean, to my dwelling,</i>&rsquo; and, in the song of the Fates at the marriage
of Thetis in Catullus, the line&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Currite ducentes subtemina, currite
fusi!</i>&rsquo; and there can be no question, the movements and gestures of the
Furies while singing this hymn were such as to indicate the scapeless
net of woe with which they were now encompassing their victim.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Mül</span>.
The reader will observe how impressively the metre changes on the
recurrence of this burden, the rhythm in the original being Pæonic <i>v v

sufficiently obvious. I have done what I could to make the transition

I have paraphrased, or rather interpolated, in this Antistrophe, a
little, because I do not see much in it that is either translatable or
worth translating. A meaning has been squeezed out of the two lines
beginning σπευδόμενοι; but one cannot help feeling, after all, that
there is something wrong, and saying with honest Wellauer, &ldquo;<i>certi nihil
video.</i>&rdquo; The main idea, shimmering through the first three lines, is
plain enough&mdash;<i>that the Furies exercise a function, the legitimacy of
which no one is entitled to question.</i> This the words, μηδ ες

The Sigean territory in the Troad was disputed between the Athenians and
the people of Mitylene; which strife Herodotus informs us (V. 94) ended,
by the activity of Pisistratus, in favour of the Athenians&mdash;B.C. 606. In
that same territory, continues the historian, there was a temple of
Pallas, where the Athenians hung up the arms of the poet Alcæus, who,
though &ldquo;<i>ferox bello</i>,&rdquo; had been obliged to flee from the battle which
decided the matter in favour of the Athenians. Æschylus, like a true
patriot and poet, throws the claim of the Athenians to this territory as
far back into the heroic times as possible; and, by the words put into
the mouth of Athena, makes the claim <span class="pagenum">{381}</span> on the part of the Lesbians
tantamount to sacrilege.&mdash;See <span class="sc">Scholiast</span> and <span class="sc">Stan</span>.

I will not multiply citations here to show the reader how this pride or
insolence of disposition, ὓβρις (the German <i>Uebermuth</i>), is marked by
the Greek moralists as the great source of all the darker crimes with
which the annals of our floundering race are stained (See Note, <a href="#pg349">p. 349</a>
above). They are wrong who tell us that Humility is a Christian and not
a Heathen virtue: no doubt the name ταπεινοφροσύνη, used in the New
Testament, was not the fashionable one among the Greeks: but that they
had the thing, every page of their poetry testifies, with this
difference, however, to be carefully noted, that while Heathen humility
is founded solely on a sense of dependence, Christian humility proceeds
also, and perhaps more decidedly, from a sense of guilt. Neither does
the phraseology of Heathen and Christian writers on this subject differ
always so much as people seem to imagine; between the μη ὐπερφρον(ε)ιν
παρ ὃ δεῖ φρονεῖν of St. Paul (Rom. xii. 3), and the ὀυδεπώποτε ὐπερ
ἄνθρωπον ἐφρόνησα of Xenophon (Cyropaed. VIII), it were a foolish

Or, with <span class="sc">Buck</span>., &ldquo;what laver of his tribe shall receive him?&rdquo;&mdash;the
word in the original being φρατόρων. The ancient Hellenic tribes
φράτραι were social unions, founded originally in the family tie, and
afterwards extended. These unions had certain religious ceremonies
which they performed in common, and to which allusion is here made.
(Compare Livy VI. 40, 41, <i>nos privatim auspicia habemus</i> of the
Patrician families.) To be ἀφρήτωρ, or <i>excluded from a tribe</i> (Il.
IX. 63), was among the Greeks of the heroic ages a penalty half-civil,
half-religious, similar in character to the <i>excommunication</i> of the
middle ages. Of this extremely interesting subject, the English reader
will find a most luminous exposition in <span class="sc">Grote</span>&rsquo;s <i>Greece</i>, vol. iii.

<p>
Strange as this doctrine may seem to our modern physiologists, it seems
founded on a very natural notion; and to the Greeks, who had such a low
estimate of women, must have appeared perfectly orthodox. The same
doctrine is enunciated by the poet in the Suppliants, v. 279, when he
says, &ldquo;the male artist has imprinted a Cyprian character on your female
features&rdquo;&mdash;the image being borrowed from the art of coining. And this,
like many fancies cherished by the Greeks, seems to have had its home
originally in <span class="pagenum">{384}</span> Egypt. <span class="sc">Stan</span>. quotes from Diodorus I. 80, who
says&mdash;&ldquo;The Egyptians count none of their sons bastards, not even the
sons of a bought slave. For they are of opinion that the father is the
only author of generation; the mother but supplieth space and
nourishment to the fœtus.&rdquo; In the play of Euripides, Orestes uses the
same argument (Orest. 543).

<p>
This address of the goddess, of practical wisdom, in constituting the
Court of the Areopagus, was pointed by the poet directly against the
democratic spirit, in his day beginning to become rampant in Athens; and
is applicable not less to all times in which great and, perhaps,
necessary social changes take place. The poet states, with the most
solemn distinctness, that the mere love of liberty will never protect
liberty from degenerating into licentiousness; but that a religious
reverence for law is as essential to society as a religious jealousy of
despotism. Only he who profoundly fears God can dispense with the fear
of man; and he who fears both God and man is the only good citizen.

There is no small difficulty in this passage, from the state of the

rather a bold measure, and has found no favour. It remains, therefore,
only to make such changes in the text as will admit of the application
of the whole passage to the Fates, who stand in the closest relation to
the Furies, as is evident from Strophe III. of the chorus (<a href="#pg146">p. 146</a>

On <a href="#pg132">p. 132</a>, after the <i>dramatis personæ</i>, I perceive that I have stated

Athens. This is either inaccurate, or, at least, imperfect; for the
first change of scene is manifestly (as stated <a href="#pg148">p. 148</a>), to the temple of
Athena Pallas, on the Acropolis; and, though the imagination naturally
desires that the institution of the Court of the Areopagus should take
place on the exact seat of its future labours, yet the construction of
the drama by no means necessitates another change of scene, and the

Homer, Odyssey xix. 407). And, indeed, in all original languages, like
Greek or German, which declare their own etymology publicly to the most
unlearned, no taunt is more natural and more obvious than that derived
from a name. Even in Scotland, a man who is called <i>Bairnsfather</i> will
be apt to feel rather awkward if he has no children. &ldquo;In the oldest
Greek legend,&rdquo; says <span class="sc">Welcker</span> (<i>Tril.</i> p. 356), &ldquo;names were frequently
invented, in order to fix down the character or main feature of the
story&rdquo;&mdash;(so Bunyan in the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress)&mdash;a true principle, which
many German writers abuse, to evaporate all tradition into mere
fictitious allegory. But the practice of the Old Testament patriarchs
shows that the significancy of a name affords of itself no presumption
against its historical reality.

<i>Prometheus</i>. The critics remark with good reason the propriety of the
stout-hearted sufferer observing complete silence up to this point. It
is natural for pain to find a vent in words, but a proud man will not
complain in the presence of his adversary. Compare the similar silence
of Cassandra in the Agamemnon; and for reasons equally wise, that of
Faust in the Auerbach cellar scene. So true is it that a great poet,
like a wise man, is often best known, not by what he says, but by what
he does <i>not</i> say&mdash;(και τῆς ἂγαν γάρ έστί που σιγῆς βάρος, as Sophocles
has it). As to the subject of the beautiful invocation here made by the
Titan sufferer, the reader will observe not merely its poetical beauty

the Greek gods, though lost by anthropomorphism to the vulgar, was
afterwards brought out by the natural philosophers, and by the

The ancient sea-goddess, sister and wife of Oceanus, daughter of Heaven
and Earth. The reader will observe that the mythology of this drama
preserves a primeval or, according to our phrase, antediluvian character
throughout. The mythic personages are true contemporaries belonging to
the most ancient dynasty of the gods. For this reason Ocean appears in a
future stage of the play, not <i>Poseidon</i>. Tethys, with the other Titans
and Titanesses are enumerated by Hesiod, Theog. 132-7, as follows&mdash;

As for the epithet <i>prolific</i> applied to <i>Tethys</i>, the fecundity of fish

Here we have distinctly indicated that contrast between the <i>old</i> and

scholars that Æschylus was secretly unfavourable to the recognised
dynasty of Jove, and that his real allegiance was to these elder gods.
But the inference is hasty and unauthorised. His taste for the sublime
led him into these primeval ages, as it also did Milton: that is all we
can say.

This is one of the passages which has suggested to many minds a
comparison between the mythical tortures of the Caucasus and the real

inhabitants of New Holland, and the wild African bushmen described by
Moffat, the missionary, are among the lowest specimens of human nature

in this whole piece the notion of primitive humanity given in his
introductory chapters by Diodorus, and generally received amongst the
ancients, viz., that the fathers of our race were the most weak and

<p>
If the reader is a curious person, he will ask how Atlas when standing
on the Earth&mdash;in the extreme west of the Earth&mdash;could bear the pillars
of <i>Heaven</i> <span class="sc">and</span> <i>Earth?</i> and the question will be a very proper one;
for the fact is that, as Hesiod distinctly states the case, he bore the
pillars of <i>Heaven only</i> (Theog. 517). This is, indeed, the only
possible idea that could be admitted into a mythology which proceeded on
the old principle that the Earth was a flat solid platform in the centre
of the Universe, round which the celestial pole (πόλος) wheeled.
The phrase &ldquo;<i>pillars of Heaven and Earth</i>&rdquo; is, therefore, to a certain
extent an improper one; for the Earth, being the stable base of all
things, required no pillars to support it. In one sense it is true that
the pillars of Atlas are the pillars of Heaven and Earth, viz., in so
far as they have Heaven at one end and Earth at the other, which is what
Homer means when he says (Odyssey I. 54), that these pillars &ldquo;γᾶιάν τε
καὶ ὀυρανὸν ἀμφὶς ἔχουσιν.&rdquo; And that this is the idea of Æschylus, also,
is plain, both from the present passage, and from the Epode of the next
following Chorus, where, unless we force in one conjecture of Schütz,
or another of Hermann into the text, there is no mention of anything but
the <i>celestial pole</i>. In all this I but express in my own words, <span class="pagenum">{394}</span>

The idea of Typhon is that of a strong windy power, δεινόν ὑβριστήν
τ ἄνεμον, according to the express statement of Hesiod (Theog. 307).
The Greek word <i>Typhon</i>, with which our <i>typhus fever</i> is identical,
expresses the state of being <i>swollen</i> or <i>blown up</i>; with this, the
other idea of <i>heat</i>, which belongs also to Typhon (Sallust, περὶ θεῶν,
c. 4), is naturally connected. According to the elementary or physical
system of mythology, therefore, Typhon is neither more nor less than a
<i>simoom</i> or <i>hot wind</i>.

Here, and in the epithet of the rivers in the Epode (compare Homer&rsquo;s
Odyssey X. 351, ἱερων ποταμων, and <i>Nägelsbach</i>, Homer, Theologie, p.
85), the original word is ἁγνος, a term to be particularly noted, both
in the heathen writers and in the Old Testament, as denoting that
religious purity in connection with external objects and outward
ceremonies which the Christian sentiment confines exclusively to the
moral state of the soul. I have thought it important, in all cases, to
retain the Greek phrase, and not by modernizing to dilute it. The
religious sentiment in connection with external nature is what the
moderns generally do not understand, and least of all the English, whose
piety does not readily exhibit itself beyond the precincts of the church
porch. The Germans, in this regard, have a much more profound sympathy
with the Greek mind.

With regard to the origin of the human race there are two principal
opinions, which have in all times prevailed. One is, that man was
originally created perfect, or in a state of dignity far transcending
what he now exhibits; that the state in which the earliest historical
records present him is a state of declension and aberration from the
primeval source; and that the <span class="pagenum">{395}</span> whole progress of what is called
civilization is only a series of attempts, for the most part
sufficiently clumsy, and always painful, whereby we endeavour to
reinstate ourselves in our lost position. This philosophy of
history&mdash;for so it may most fitly be called&mdash;is that which has always
been received in the general Christian world; and, indeed, it seems to
flow necessarily from the reception of the Mosaic records, not merely as
authentic Hebrew documents, but as veritable cosmogony and primeval
history&mdash;as containing a historical exposition of the creation of the
world, and the early history of man. The other doctrine is, that man was
originally created in a condition extremely feeble and imperfect; very
little removed from vegetable dulness and brutish stupidity; and that he
gradually raised himself by slow steps to the exercise of the higher
moral and intellectual faculties, by virtue of which he claims
successful mastery over the brute, and affinity with the angel. This
doctrine was very common, I think I may safely say the current and
generally received doctrine, among the educated Greeks and Romans;
though the poets certainly did not omit, as they so often do, to
contradict themselves by their famous tradition of a golden age, which
it was their delight to trick out and embellish. In modern times, this
theory of <i>progressive development</i>, as it may be called, has, as might
have been expected, found little favour, except with philosophers of the
French school; and those who have broached it in this country latterly
have met with a most hot reception from scientific men, principally, we
may presume, from the general conviction that such ideas go directly to
undermine the authority of the Mosaic record. It has been thought, also,
that there is something debasing and contrary to the dignity of human
nature in the supposition that the great-grandfather of the primeval
father of our race may have been a monkey, or not far removed from that
species; but, however this be, with regard to <span class="sc">Æschylus</span>, it is plain
he did not find it inconsistent with the loftiest views of human duty
and destiny to adopt the then commonly received theory of a gradual
development; and, in illustration, I cannot do better than translate a
few sentences from <span class="sc">Diodorus</span>, where the same doctrine is stated in
prose: &ldquo;Men, as originally generated, lived in a confused and brutish
condition, preserving existence by feeding on herbs and fruits that grew
spontaneously. * * * Their speech was quite indistinct and confused, but
by degrees they invented articulate speech. * * * They lived without any
of the comforts and conveniences of life, without clothing, without
habitations, <i>without fire</i> (Prometheus!), and without cooked victuals;
and not knowing to lay up stores for future need, great numbers of them
died during the winter from the effects of cold and starvation. By which
sad experience taught, they learned to lodge themselves in caves, and
laid up stores there. By-and-by, they discovered fire and other things
pertaining to a comfortable existence. The arts were then invented, and
man became in every respect such as a highly-gifted animal might well
be, having hands and speech, and a devising mind ever present to work
out his purposes.&rdquo; Thus far the Sicilian (I. 8); and the intelligent
reader need not be informed that, to a certain extent, many obvious and
patent facts seemed to give a high probability to his doctrine.
&ldquo;Dwellers in caves,&rdquo; for instance, or &ldquo;troglodytes,&rdquo; were well known to
the ancients, and the modern reader will find a historical account of
them in <span class="sc">Strabo</span>, and other obvious places. The <span class="sc">Horites</span> (Gen. xiv. 6)
were so called from the Hebrew word <span class="sc">Hor</span>, a cave&mdash;(see Gesenius and
Jahn, I. 2-26). But it is needless to accumulate learned references in a
matter patent to the most modern observation.&mdash;<span class="sc">Moffat</span>&rsquo;s &ldquo;African
Missions&rdquo; will supply instances of human beings in a state as degraded
as anything here described by the poet; and with <span class="pagenum">{396}</span> regard to the
aboriginal Australians, I have preserved in my notes the following
passage from <span class="sc">Collins</span>: &ldquo;The Australians dwell in miserable huts of
bark, all huddled together promiscuously (ἔφυρον εικῆ πάντα!) amid much
smoke and dirt. <i>Some also live in caves.</i>&rdquo; I do by no means assert,
however, that these creatures are remnants of primeval humanity,
according to the development theory; I only say they afford that theory
a historic analogy; while, on the other hand, they are equally
consistent with the commonly received Christian doctrine, as man is a
creature who degenerates from excellence much more readily in all
circumstances than he attains to it. These Australians and Africans may
be mere imbecile stragglers who have been dropt from the great army of
humanity in its march.

<p>
Necessity (Ἀνάγκη), a favourite power to which reference is made
by the Greek dramatists, is merely an impersonation of the fact patent
to all, that the world is governed by a system of strict and inexorable
law, from the operation of which no man can escape. That the gods
themselves are subject to this Ἀνάγκη. is a method of expression
not seldom used by Heathen writers; but that they had any distinct idea,
or fixed theological notion of <span class="sc">Necessity</span> or <span class="sc">Fate</span>, as a power
separate from and superior to the gods I see no reason to believe.&mdash;See
my observations on the Homeric μοῖρα in <i>Clas. Mus.</i>, No. XXVI.,
p. 437. And in the same way that Homer talks of the <i>fate from the
gods</i>, so the tragedians talk of <i>necessity from or imposed by the
gods</i>&mdash;τὰς γὰρ ἐκ θεῶν ἀνάγκας θνητον ὀντα δεῖ φέρειν. With regard to
Æschylus, certainly one must beware of drawing any hasty inference with
regard to his theological creed from this insulated passage. For here
the poet adopts the notion of the strict subjection of Jove to an
external <span class="sc">Fate</span>, <span class="pagenum">{397}</span> principally, one may suppose, from dramatic
propriety; it suits the person and the occasion. Otherwise, the
Æschylean theology is very favourable to the absolute supremacy of
Jove; and, accordingly, in the Eumenides, those very Furies, who are
here called his superiors, though they dispute with Apollo, are careful
not to be provoked into a single expression which shall seem to throw a
doubt on the infallibility of &ldquo;the Father.&rdquo; For the rest, the Fates and
Furies, both here and in the Eumenides, are aptly coupled, and, in
signification, indeed, are identical; because a man&rsquo;s <i>fate</i> in this
world can never be separated from his <i>conduct</i>, nor his conduct from
his <i>conscience</i>, of which the Furies are the impersonation.

<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Io</span>. Io is one of those mysterious characters on the
borderland between history and fable, concerning which it is difficult
to say whether they are to be looked on as personal realities, or as
impersonated ideas. According to the historical view of ancient legends,
Io is the daughter of Inachus, a primeval king of Argos; and, from this
fact as a root, the extravagant legends about her, sprouting from the
ever active inoculation of human fancy, branched out. Interpreted by the
principles of early theological allegory, however, she is, according to
the witness of Suidas, the <span class="sc">Moon</span>, and her wanderings the revolutions of
that satellite. In either view, the immense extent of these wanderings
is well explained by mythological writers (1) from the influence of
Argive colonies at Byzantium and elsewhere; and (2) from the vain desire
of the Greeks to connect their <span class="pagenum">{398}</span> horned virgin Io, with the horned
<span class="sc">Isis</span> of the Egyptians. It need scarcely be remarked that, if Io means
the moon, her horns are as naturally explained as her wanderings. But,
in reading Æschylus, all these considerations are most wisely left out
of view, the Athenians, no doubt, who introduced this play, believing in
the historical reality of the Inachian maid, as firmly as we believe in
that of Adam or Methuselah. As little can I agree with <span class="sc">Both</span>. that we
are called upon to rationalize away the reality of the persecuting
insect, whether under the name of ᾽(ο)ιστρος or μύωψ. In popular legends
the sublime is ever apt to be associated with circumstances that either
are, or, to the cultivated imagination, necessarily appear to be
ridiculous.

Here begins the narration of the mythical wanderings of Io&mdash;a strange
matter, and of a piece with the whole fable, which, however, with all
its perplexities, Æschylus, no doubt, and his audience, following the
old minstrels, took very lightly. In such matters, the less curious a
man is, <span class="pagenum">{399}</span> the greater chance is there of his not going far wrong;
and to be superficial is safer than to be profound. The following causes
may be stated as presumptive grounds why we ought not to be surprised at
any startling inaccuracy in geographical detail in legends of this
kind:&mdash;(1) The Greeks, as stated above, even in their most scientific
days, had the vaguest possible ideas of the geography of the extreme
circumference of the habitable globe and the parts nearest to it which
are spoken of in the passage. (2) The geographical ideas of Æschylus
must be assumed as more kindred to those of Homer than of the best
informed later Greeks. (3) Even supposing Æschylus to have had the most
accurate geographical ideas, he had no reasons in handling a Titanic
myth to make his geographical scenery particularly tangible; on the
contrary, as a skilful artist, the more misty and indefinite he could
keep it the better. (4) He may have taken the wanderings of Io, as
Welcker still suggests (<i>Trilog.</i> 137), literally from the old Epic poem
&ldquo;Aigimius,&rdquo; or some other traditionary lay as old as Homer, leaving to
himself no more discretion in the matter, and caring as little to do so
as Shakespere did about the geographical localities in Macbeth, which he
borrowed from Hollinshed. For all these reasons I am of opinion that any
attempt to explain the geographical difficulties of the following
wanderings would be labour lost to myself no less than to the reader;
and shall, therefore, content myself with noting <i>seriatim</i> the
different points of the progress, and explaining, for the sake of the

ἔυποτον ρέος, literally, <i>good for drinking</i>. The medicinal qualities of
the <i>Nile</i> were famous in ancient times. In the Suppliants, v. 556, our
poet calls the Nile water, νόσοις ἄθικτον, <i>not to be reached by
diseases;</i> and in v. 835, <i>the nurturing river that makes the blood
flow more buoyantly</i>. On this subject, the celebrated Venetian
physician, Prosper Alpin, in his <i>Rerum Ægyptiarum</i>, Lib. IV. (Lugd.
Bat. 1735) writes as follows: &ldquo;Nili aqua merito omnibus aliis præfertur
quod ipsa alvum subducat, menses pellat ut propterea raro mensium
suppressio in Ægypti mulieribus reperiatur. Potui suavis est, et
dulcis; sitim promptissime extinguit; frigida tuto bibitur, concoctionem
juvat, ac distributioni auxilio est, minime hypochondriis gravis corpus
firmum et coloratum reddit,&rdquo; etc.&mdash;Lib. I. c. 3. If the water of the
Nile really be not only pleasant to drink, but, strictly speaking, of
medicinal virtue, it has a companion in the Ness, at Inverness, the
waters of which are said to possess such a drastic power, that they
cannot be drunk with safety by strangers.

I quite agree with <span class="sc">Schoe</span>. that, in the word παλιμπλάγκτος, in this

could never have been brought northward to Scythia. The maziness of Io&rsquo;s
course arises naturally from the fitful attacks of the persecuting
insect of which she was the victim. A direct course is followed by sane
reason, a zigzag course by insane impulse.

As Io was identified with Isis, so Epaphus seems merely a Greek term for
the famous bull-god Apis.&mdash;(Herod. III. 27, and Müller&rsquo;s Prolegom.
myth.) The etymology, like many others given by the ancients, is
ridiculous enough; ἐπαφή, <i>touch</i>. This derivation is often alluded to
in the next play, <i>The Suppliants</i>. With regard to the idea of a virgin
mother so prominent in this legend of Io, <span class="sc">Prow</span>. has remarked that it
occurs in the Hindoo and in the Mexican mythology; but nothing can be
more puerile than the attempt which he mentions as made by <span class="sc">Faber</span> to
connect this idea with the &ldquo;promise respecting the seed of the woman
made to man at the fall.&rdquo; Sound philosophy will never seek a distant
reason for a phenomenon, when a near one is ready. When an object of
worship or admiration is once acknowledged as superhuman, it is the most
natural thing in the world for the imagination to supply a superhuman
birth. A miraculous life flows most fitly from a miraculous generation.
The mother of the great type of Roman <span class="pagenum">{402}</span> warriors is a vestal, and
his father is the god of war. Romans and Greeks will wisely be left to
settle such matters for themselves, without the aid of &ldquo;patriarchal
traditions&rdquo; or &ldquo;the prophecy of Isaiah.&rdquo; The ancient Hellenes were not
so barren, either of fancy or feeling, as that they required to borrow
matters of this kind from the Hebrews. On the idea of &ldquo;generation by a
god&rdquo; generally, see the admirable note in <span class="sc">Grote</span>&rsquo;s History of Greece,

<p>
The idea of vicarious sacrifice, or punishment by substitution of one
person for another, does not seem to have been very familiar to the
Greek mind; at least, I do not trace it in Homer. It occurs, however,
most distinctly in the well-known case of <span class="sc">Menœceus</span>, in Euripides&rsquo;
play of the <span class="sc">Phœnissæ</span>. In this passage, also, it is plainly implied,
though the word διάδοχος, strictly translated, means only a
<i>successor</i>, and not a <i>substitute</i>. <span class="sc">Welck</span>. (<i>Trilog</i>. p. 47) has
pointed out that the person here alluded to is the centaur <span class="sc">Chiron</span>, of
whom Apollodorus (II. 5-11-12) says that &ldquo;Hercules, after freeing
Prometheus, who had assumed the olive chaplet (<span class="sc">Welck</span>. reads
ἑλόμένον), delivered up Chiron to Jove willing, though immortal, to
die in his room (θνήσκειν ὰντ᾽ ἁυτου). This is literally the Christian
idea of vicarious death. The Druids, according to Cæsar (<span class="sc">b.c.</span> VI.
16), held the doctrine strictly&mdash;&ldquo;<i>pro vita hominis nisi hominis vita
reddatur non posse aliter deorum immortalium numen placari.</i>&rdquo; Of
existing heathens practising human sacrifice, the religious rites of the
Khonds in Orissa present the idea <span class="pagenum">{403}</span> of vicarious sacrifice in the
most distinct outline. See the interesting memoir of Captain Macpherson
in <i>Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine</i> for August, 1842.

<p>
Ζεὺς ἀφίκτωρ, literally <i>suppliant Jove</i>, the epithet which properly
belongs to the worshipper being transferred to the object of worship.
The reader will note here another instance of the monotheistic element
in Polytheism, so often alluded to in these Notes. Jove, as the supreme
moral governor of the universe, has a general supervision of the whole
social system of gods and men; and specially where there is no inferior
protector, as in the case of fugitives and suppliants&mdash;there he presses
with all the weight of his high authority. In such cases, religion
presents a generous and truly humanizing aspect, and the &ldquo;<i>primus in
orbe Deos fecit timor</i>&rdquo; of the philosophers loses its sting.

<span class="sc">Epaphus</span>, meaning, as it does, <i>touch</i>. To the Greeks, as already
remarked (<a href="#pg388">p. 388</a>), this was no mere punning; and the names of the gods
(<a href="#n_pro_17b">Note 17</a>, p. 391 above) were one of the strongest instruments of Heathen
devotion. That there is an allusion to this in Matthew vi. 7, I have no

destruction of the wicked, so finely expressed in the preceding stanzas,
supports the sinking soul but weakly in this closing part of the hymn.
These alterations of feeling exhibited under such circumstances will
appear strange to no one who is acquainted with the human, and
especially with the female heart.

like the Herald in that play, had just escaped from a great struggle,
or, like the fugitive Virgins in this piece, were going through one,
there does not appear to be any great impropriety (notwithstanding
<span class="sc">Pal</span>.&rsquo;s. <i>inepte</i>) in an appeal to the gods of combat. Opposed to this
interpretation, however, we have the common practice of Homer, with whom
the substantive ἀγών generally means an assembly; and the testimony
of Eustathius, who, in his notes to <span class="pagenum">{406}</span> that poet, Iliad, Ω 1335, 58, says
&ldquo;παρ Αισχύλῳ ἀγώνιοι θεοὶ ὁι ἀγορᾶιοι;&rdquo; <i>i.e. gods that preside over

This seems to have been a common-place among the ancients. <span class="sc">Pliny</span>, in
the following passage, draws a contrast between man and the inferior
animals, not much to the honor of the former:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Cætera animalia in suo
genere probe degunt; congregari videmus et stare contra dissimilia;
leonum feritas inter se non dimicat; serpentum morsus non petit
serpentes; ne maris quidem belluæ ac pisces nisi in diversa genera
sæviunt. At hercule homini plarima ex homine sunt mala.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Nat. Hist</span>.
VII. proem. This custom of blackening human nature (which is bad enough,
without being made worse) has been common enough also in modern times,
especially among a certain school of theologians, very far, indeed, in
other respects, from claiming kindred with the Roman polyhistor; but the
fact is, one great general law over-rides both man and the brute, viz.
this&mdash;<span class="sc">Like herds</span> <span class="pagenum">{407}</span> <span class="sc">with like</span>&mdash;the only difference being that human
beings, with a great outward similarity, are characterized by a more
various inward diversity than the lower animals. There are, in fact, men
of all various kinds represented in the moral world&mdash;all those varieties
which different races and species exhibit in the physical. There are
lamb-men, tiger-men, serpent-men, pigeon-men, and hawk-men. That such
discordant natures should sometimes, nay always in a certain sense,
strive, is a necessary consequence of their existing.

<p>
This is somewhat of a circumlocution for the single Greek phrase,
ἱατρόμαντις, <i>physician-prophet</i>; a name applied to Apollo himself by
the Pythoness, in the prologue to the Eumenides (<a href="#pg142">p. 142</a> above). The
original conjunction of the two offices of prophet and leech in the
person of Melampus, Apis, Chiron, etc. and their patron Apollo, is a
remarkable fact in the history of civilization. The multiplication and
isolation of professions originally combined and confounded is a
natural enough consequence of the progress of society, of which
examples occur in every sphere of human activity; but there is,
besides, a peculiar fitness in the conjunction of <span class="pagenum">{408}</span> medicine and
theology, arising from the intimate connexion of mind with bodily
ailment, too much neglected by some modern drug-minglers, and also, from
the fact that, in ancient times, nothing was more common than to refer
diseases, especially those of a striking kind, to the immediate
interference of the Divine chastiser&mdash;(see Hippocrates περὶ ἱερῆς νόσου
<i>init</i>.). Men are never more disposed to acknowledge divine power than
when under the influence of severe affliction; and accordingly we find
that, in some savage or semi-savage tribes, the &ldquo;medicine-man&rdquo; is the
only priest. It would be well, indeed, if, in the present state of
advanced science, professional men would more frequently attempt to
restore the original oneness of the healing science&mdash;(see Max. Tyr.
πῶς ᾶν τις ἄλυπος ἒιη)&mdash;if all medical men would, like the late Dr.
Abercrombie, bear in mind that man has a soul as well as a body, and all
theologians more distinctly know that human bodies enclose a stomach as
well as a conscience, with which latter the operations of the former are
often strangely confounded.

This is a very interesting passage in reference to the political
constitution&mdash;if the term constitution be here allowable&mdash;of the loose
political aggregates of the heroic ages. The Chorus, of course, speak
only their own feelings; but their feelings, in this case, are in
remarkable consistency with the usages of the ancient Greeks, as
described by Homer. The government of the heroic ages, as it appears in
the Iliad, was a monarchy, on common occasions absolute, but liable to
be limited by a circumambient atmosphere of oligarchy, and the
prospective possibility of resistance on the part of a people habitually
passive. Another remarkable circumstance, is the identity of church and
state, well indicated by Virgil, in that line&mdash;

and concerning which, Ottfried Müller says&mdash;&ldquo;In ancient Greece it may
be said, with almost equal truth, that the kings were priests, as that
the priests were kings&rdquo; (Mythology, Leitch, p. 187). On this identity of
church and state were founded those laws against the worship of strange
gods, which formed so remarkable an exception to the comprehensive
spirit of toleration that Hume and Gibbon have not unjustly lauded as
one of the advantageous concomitants of Polytheism. The intolerance,
which is the necessary consequence of such an identity, has found its
thorough and consistent champions only among the Mahommedan and
Christian monotheists of modern times. Even the large-hearted and
liberal-minded Dr. Arnold was so far possessed by the ancient doctrine
of the identity of church and state, that he could not conceive of the
possibility of admitting Jews to deliberate in the senate of a Christian
state. In modern times, also, we have witnessed with wonder the full
development of a doctrine most characteristically Homeric, that the
absolute power of kings, whether in civil or in ecclesiastical matters,
is equally <i>of divine right</i>.

Æschylus makes the monarch of the heroic ages speak here with a strong
tincture of the democracy of the latter times of Greece, no doubt
securing <span class="pagenum">{410}</span> to himself thereby immense billows of applause from his
Athenian auditors, as the tragedians were fond of doing, by giving
utterance to liberal sentiments like that of Æmon in Sophocles&mdash;&ldquo;πόλις
γὰρ ὀυκ ἒσθ ἣτις ἀνδρός ἐσθ᾽ ἑνός.&rdquo; But how little the people had to
say in the government of the heroic ages appears strikingly in that most
dramatic scene described in the second book of the Iliad, which <span class="sc">Grote</span>
(II. 94) has, with admirable judgment, brought prominently forward in
his remarks on the power of the ἀγορά, or popular assembly, in the

As the opening words of this prayer generally are one of the finest

are often applied with a peculiar significancy to the king of the

the lawyers say, to suppose that this epithet, as some modern scholars
suggest, has nothing to do etymologically with λύκος, <i>a wolf</i>, but
rather with the root <span class="pagenum">{412}</span> λυκ, which we find in the substantive
λυκάβας, and in the Latin <i>luceo</i>. Æschylus, however, in the <span class="sc">Seven

will be seen from my version. I have only to add that, if Artemis be

the present passage, is the most natural thing in the world. On this

<span class="sc">Choral Hymn</span>. This final Chorus of the Suppliants and the opening one
of the Persians are remarkable for the use of that peculiar rhythm,
technically called the <i>Ionic a minore</i>, of which a familiar example
exists in Horace, Ode III. 12. What the æsthetical or moral effect of
this measure was on an Athenian ear it is perhaps impossible for us, at
the present day, to know; but I have thought it right, in both cases,
when it occurs, to mark the peculiarity by the adoption of an English
rhythm, in some similar degree removed from the vulgar use, and not
without a certain cognate character. In modern music, at least, the
Ionic of the Greek text and the measure used in my translation are mere
varieties of the same rhythmical genus marked musically by ¾. As for
the structure of the Chorus, its division into two semi-choruses is
anticipative of the division of feeling among the sisters, which
afterwards arose when the conduct of their stern father forced them to
choose between filial and connubial duty. One thing also is plain, that
there is nothing of a real moral finale in this Chorus. Regarded as a
concluding ode, it were a most weak and impotent performance. The tone
of grateful jubilee with which it sets out, is, after the second
Strophe, suddenly changed into the original note of apprehension,
evil-foreboding, doubt, and anxiety, plainly pointing to the terrible
catastrophe to be unveiled in the immediately succeeding play.

The Chorus here are evidently moved by a religious apprehension that, in
placing themselves under the patronage of the goddess of chastity, they
may have treated lightly the power and the functions of the great
goddess of <span class="pagenum">{415}</span> love. To reconcile the claims of opposing deities was a
great problem of practical piety with all devout polytheists. The
introduction of Aphrodite here, as has been remarked, is also plainly
prophetic of the part which Hypermnestra is to play in the subsequent
piece, under the influence of the great Cyprian goddess preferring the
love of a husband to the command of a father.

<p>
The epithet ἀλεξητηριος or ἀλεξίκακος (Pausan. Att. III.) or the
averter, applied to the gods (see Odys. III. 346, is to be noted), as
characteristic of the grand fact in the history of mind, that with rude
nations the fear of evil is the dominant religious motive; so much so,
that in the accounts which we read of some savage, or semi-savage
nations, religion seems to consist altogether in a vague, dim fear of
some unknown power, either without moral attributes altogether, or even
positively malignant. In this historical sense, the famous maxim,
<i>primus in orbe deos fecit timor</i>&mdash;however insufficient as a principle
of general theology&mdash;is quite true. In the present passage, the
phraseology is remarkable.

<span class="sc">Chorus</span>. This Chorus, <span class="sc">Schneider</span> remarks, naturally divides itself
into four, or, as I think, rather into five distinct parts, (1) The
Chorus enter the stage in great hurry and agitation, indicated by the
Dochmiac verse&mdash;σποράδην, according to the analogy of the
Eumenides&mdash;(see the βιος Αισχύλου)&mdash;in scattered array, and, perhaps
in the person of their Coryphæus, describe generally the arrival of the
Theban host, and their march against the walls of Thebes. (2) But as the
agitation increases, continuity of description becomes impossible, and a
series of broken and irregular exclamations and invocations by
individual voices follows. (3) Then a more regular prayer, or the
chaunting of the Theban litany begins, in which we must suppose the
whole band to join. (4) This is interrupted, however, by the near terror
of the assault, and the chaunt is again broken into hurried exclamations
of individual voices. (5) The litany is then wound up by the whole band.
Of course no absolute external proof of matters of this kind can be
offered; but the internal evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant the
translator in marking the peculiar character of the Chorus in some such
manner as I have done. For dramatic effect, this is of the utmost
consequence. Nothing has more hurt the dramatic character of Æschylus,
than the practice of throwing into the form of a continuous ode what was
written for a series of well-arranged individual voices. Whoever he was
among more recent scholars that first analyzed the Choruses with a
special view to separate the exclamatory parts from the continuous
chaunt deserves my best thanks.&mdash;See <a href="#n_eum_19b">Note 19</a> to the <span class="sc">Eumenides</span>, <a href="#pg377">p. 377</a>.

was slain by the Phœnician wanderer, was sacred to that god.

Bells were often used on the harness of horses, and on different parts
of the armour, to increase the war-alarm&mdash;the κλαγγή τε ἐνοπή τε (Il.
III. 2), which is so essential a part of the instinct of assault. See
the description of Tydeus below, and Dict. Antiq. <i>tintinnabulum</i>,
where is represented a fragment of ancient sculpture, showing the
manner in which bells were attached to the collars of war-horses. Dio
Cassius (Lib. LXXVI. 12) mentions that &ldquo;the arms of the Britons are a
shield and short spear, in the upper part whereof is an apple of
brass, which, being shaken, terrifies the enemy with the sound.&rdquo;

Neptune is called equestrian or ἱππίος, no doubt, from the analogy of
the swift waves, over which his car rides, to the fleet ambling of
horses. In the mythical contest with Pallas, accordingly, while the

war-horse.

Here is one of those pious puns upon the epithets of the gods, which

who, in the Electra of <span class="sc">Sophocles</span>, v. 6, is called distinctly

Scholiast on that passage is right in referring this function to

Diomedes, whose exploits against men and gods are so nobly sung in Iliad
V. From the frequency of the words βοᾶν, βοὴν, βρέμειν, etc. in this
fine description, one might almost think that Æschylus had wished to
paint the father after the Homeric likeness of the son, who, like
Menelaus, was βοὴν ἀγαθός. In the heroic ages, a pair of brazen lungs
was not the least useful accomplishment of a warrior. The great fame of
the father of Diomedes as a warrior appears strikingly from that passage
of the Iliad (IV. 370), where Agamemnon uses it as a strong goad to
prick the valorous purpose of the son.

Polynices gave her, she receiving the gift in the face of an interdict

Supreme Being; but in the olden time such language as that of the text

a strange sensation of mysterious terror, from our juvenile lessons;
and &ldquo;<i>quos Deus vult perdere prius dementat</i>,&rdquo; is a common maxim in
our mouths, though we scarcely half believe it. In Homer and the
tragedians instances of this kind occur everywhere; and in the
Persians of our author the gods are addressed in a style of the most
unmitigated accusation. In such cases, modern translators are often
inclined <span class="pagenum">{423}</span> to soften down the apparent impiety of the expression
into some polite modern generality; but I have scrupulously retained

his destruction by a violent unreasoning passion, reference is generally
made to an overruling decree or destiny, rather than directly to the
author of all destiny. &ldquo;But my ill-fate pushed me on with an obstinacy
that nothing could resist; and, though I had several times loud calls
from my reason and my more composed judgment to go home, yet I had no
power to do it. <i>I know not what to call this, nor will I urge that it
is a secret overruling decree that hurries us on to be the instruments
of our own destruction, even though it be before us, and that we rush
upon as with our eyes open</i>. Certainly nothing but some such decreed
unavoidable misery attending, and which it was impossible for me to
escape, could have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and
persuasions of my most retired thoughts.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. On this
subject see my <i>Homeric Theology</i>. <i>Class. Mus.</i> No. XXVI. Propositions

I have remarked, in a Note above, that the Greeks, so far from having
any objection to the idea that the gods were the authors of evil, rather
<span class="pagenum">{424}</span> encouraged it; and accordingly, in their theology, they had no
need for a devil or devils in any shape. This truth, however, must be
received with the qualification, arising from the general preponderating
character of the Greek deities, which was unquestionably benign, and
coloured more from the sunshine than the cloud; in reference to which
general character, it might well be said that certain deities, whose
function was purely to induce misery, were ὀυ θεοῖς

The word μοῖρα originally means <i>lot, portion, part, that which is
dealt or divided out to one</i>. In this sense it occurs frequently in
Homer, and is there regarded as proceeding from the gods, and specially
from Jove. But with an inconsistency natural enough in popular poetry,
we sometimes find μοῖρα in Homer, like ἀτη, elevated to the rank of a
separate divine personage. &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; says Agamemnon, in the Iliad (XIX.
86), &ldquo;was to blame for the quarrel with Achilles,

<p>
θάπτειν ἔδοξε γῆς φιλαις κατασκφαῖς. The words here used seem to imply
interment in the modern fashion, without burning, but they may also
refer to the depositing of the urns in subterranean chambers. Ancient
remains, as well as the testimony of classical authors, prove that both
practices existed among the ancients, though cremation was latterly the
more common. The reader will be instructed by the following extract on
this subject from Dr. Smith&rsquo;s admirable Dictionary of Antiquities,
article <i>Funus</i>: &ldquo;The body was either buried or burnt. Lucian, <i>de
luctu</i>, says that the Greeks burn, and the Persians bury, their dead;
but modern writers are greatly divided in opinion as to which was the
usual practice. Wachsmuth (<i>Hell. Alt.</i> II. 2, p. 79) says that, in
historical times, the dead were always buried; but this statement is not
strictly correct. Thus we find that Socrates (Plut. Phædon) speaks of
his body being either burnt or buried; the body of Timoleon was burnt;
and so was that of Philopæmon (Plutarch). The word θάπτειν is used in
connection with either mode; it is applied to the collection of the
ashes after burning; and accordingly we find the words κάιειν and
θάπτειν used together (Dionys. Archæolog. Rom. V. 48). The proper
expression for interment in the earth is κατορύττειν; whereas we find
Socrates speaking of το σῶμα η καόμενον, ἠ κατορυττόμενον. In Homer,
the bodies of the dead are burnt; but interment was also used in very
ancient times. Cicero (<i>de leg.</i> II. 25) says that the dead were buried
at Athens in the time of Cecrops; and we also read of the bones of
Orestes being found in a coffin at Tegea (Herod. I. 68). The dead were
commonly buried among the Spartans (Plut. Lycurg. 27) and the Sicyonians
(Paus. II. 7); and the prevalence of this practice is proved by the
great number of skeletons found in coffins in modern times, which have
evidently not been exposed to the action of fire. Both burning and
burying appear to have been always used, to a greater or less extent, at
different periods; till the spread of Christianity at length put an end
to the former practice.&rdquo;

I have here, by a paraphrase, endeavoured to express the remarkably
pregnant expression of the original κῆρες Εριννύες&mdash;combining, as it
does, in grammatical apposition, two terrible divine powers, that the
ancient poets generally keep separate. The κῆρες, or goddesses of
destruction and violent death, occur frequently in Homer. Strictly
speaking, they represent only one of the methods by which the
retributive Furies may operate; but, in a loose way of talking, they
are sometimes identified with them. Schoemann, in a note to the
Eumenides, p. 62, has quoted to this effect, Hesiod v. 217, and Eurip.

Here commences a series of questions with regard to Attic geography,
topography, and statistics, which to the most inexperienced reader will
appear to come in here not in the most natural way. That the mother of
Xerxes should have actually been so ignorant of the state of Athens, as
she is here dramatically represented, seems scarcely supposable. But
that she <span class="pagenum">{429}</span> and the mighty persons of the East generally were grossly
ignorant of, and greatly underrated the resources of the small state
that was rising in the West, is plain, both from the general habit of
the oriental mind, and from what Herodotus (V. 105, quoted by <span class="sc">Pal</span>.)
narrates of Darius, that, when he heard of the burning of Sardes by the
Athenians and the Ionians, he asked &ldquo;<i>who the Athenians were</i>.&rdquo; On this
foundation, a dramatic poet, willing &ldquo;to pay a pleasant compliment to
Athenian vanity&rdquo; (<span class="sc">Buck</span>.), might well erect such a series of
interrogatories as we have in the text, though it may be doubted whether
he has done it with that tact which a more perfect master of the
dramatic art&mdash;Shakespere, for instance&mdash;would have displayed. There are
not a few other passages in the Greek drama where this formal style of
questioning <i>ab ovo</i> assumes somewhat of a ludicrous aspect.

<span class="sc">Pan</span>, &ldquo;the simple shepherd&rsquo;s awe-inspiring god&rdquo; (Wordsworth, Exc. IV.),
was in the mind of the Athenians intimately associated with the glory of
the Persian wars, and regarded as one of their chief patrons at Marathon
(Herod. VI. 105). This god was the natural patron of all wild and
solitary places, such as are seldom disturbed by any human foot save
that of the Arcadian shepherds, whose imagination first produced this
half-solemn half-freakish creation; and in this view no place could be
more appropriate to him than &ldquo;the barren and rocky Psyttaleia&rdquo;
(<span class="sc">Strabo</span>, 395). That he was actually worshipped there, we have, besides
the present passage of our poet, the express testimony of Pausanias (I.
36)&mdash;&ldquo;What are called Panic terrors were ascribed to Pan; for loud
noises whose cause could not be easily traced were not unfrequently
heard in mountainous regions; and the gloom and loneliness of forests
and mountains fill the mind with a secret horror, and dispose it to

I think it right so to translate, because such is actually the colour of
the olive; but I must state, at the same time, that the word in the
original is ξανθῆς, which has been imitated by Virgil, Æn. V. 309. How
the same word should mean both <i>yellow</i> and <i>green</i>, I cannot
understand. No doubt the light green of many trees, when the leafage
first comes out in spring, has a yellowish appearance; but the
ever-green olive is always γλαυκός, as Sophocles has it (O. C. 701).
What we call <i>olive-coloured</i> is a mixture of green and yellow; does
this come from the colour of the fruit or the oil?

The word δαίμονα here used is that by which both Homer and Æschylus
designate the highest celestial beings, from which practice we see what
an easy transition there was in the minds of the early Christians to
the deification of the martyrs, and the canonization of the saints.
Compare Æn. V. v. 47. There is nothing in Popery which is not seated
in the deepest roots of human nature.

<i>i.e.</i> Pluto. The reader must not be surprised to see Æschylus putting
the names of Greek gods and Greek feelings and ideas generally into the
mouths of Persian characters. His excuse lies partly in the fact, that
these divine powers and human feelings, though in a Greek form, belonged
to the universal heart of man, and partly in the extreme nationality of
the old Hellenic culture, which was not apt to go abroad with curiously
inquiring eyes into the regions of the barbarian. A national poet,
moreover, addressing the masses, must beware of being too learned.
Shakespere, in his foreign dramas, though less erudite, is much more
effective than Southey in his Epics.

This is sound morality and orthodox theology, even at the present hour.
<i>Quos Deus vult perdere prius dementat</i>. Observe here how high Æschylus
rises in moral tone above Herodotus, who, in the style that offends us
so much in Homer, represents Xerxes, after yielding to the sensible
advice of his father&rsquo;s counsellor Artabanus, as urged on to his ruin by
a god-sent vision thrice repeated (VII. 12-18). The whole expedition,
according to the historian, is as much a matter of divine planning as
the death of Hector by Athena&rsquo;s cruel deceit in Iliad XXII. 299. Even
Artabanus is carried along by the stream of evil counsel, confessing
that δαιμονίη τις γίνεται ὁρμὴ, <i>there is an impulse from the gods</i> in
the matter which a man may not resist.&mdash;See <span class="sc">Grote</span>.

<p class="i0">&ldquo;Converse with the sons of folly taught thy eager son to err.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>
The original word for <i>eager</i> here is the same as that translated above
<i>impetuous</i>&mdash;θούριος, and had a peculiar significancy to a Greek
ear, as being that epithet by which Mars is constantly designated in the
Iliad; and this god, as the readers of that poem well know, signifies
only the wild, unreasoning hurricane power of battle, as distinguished
from the calmly-calculated, surely-guided hostility of the wise Athena.
With regard to the matter of fact asserted in this line, it is literally
true that the son of Darius was not of himself originally much inclined
to the Greek expedition (ὲπὶ μεν τὴν Ἑλλάδα ὀυδαμῶς πρόθυμος ᾖν κατ
ἀρχὰς στρατέυεσθαι.&mdash;Herod. VII. 5), but, like all weaklings in high
places, was wrought upon by others; in this case, specially, by his
cousin Mardonius, according to the account of Herodotus.&mdash;See <span class="sc">Grote</span>,

<span class="sc">Mardus</span> (commonly called <span class="sc">Smerdis</span>), and Darius, the father of Xerxes,
two intermediate names&mdash;contrary to common account&mdash;are introduced. I do
not believe our historical materials are such as entitle us curiously to
scrutinize these matters.

The <i>Maryandini</i> were a Bithynian people, near the Greek city of
Heraclea, Xenoph. Anab. vi. 2; Strabo xii. p. 542. The peasants in
that quarter were famous for singing a rustic wail, which is alluded
to in the text. See <span class="sc">Pollux</span>, Lib. iv. περὶ ᾳσμάτων ἐθνικῶν. The
<i>Mysians</i> mentioned, p. 331, below, were their next door neighbours;
and the Phrygians generally, who in a large sense include the Mysians
and Bithynians, were famous for their violent and passionate music,
displayed principally in the worship of Cybele. So the Phrygian in
Euripides (Orest. 1384) is introduced wailing ἁρμάτειον μέλος βαρβαρῳ
βοᾳ. The critics who have considered this last scene of the cantata
ridiculous, have not attended either to human nature or to the customs
of the Persians, as <span class="sc">Stan</span>. quotes them from <span class="sc">Herod</span>. ix. 24, and

I should be most happy for the sake of Æschylus, and my translation,
to think there was nothing in the ἁβροβάται. of this passage but the
natural expression of grief so simply given in the scriptural

<p class="noindent">
But there is more in ἁβρός than mere <i>gentleness</i>, and to the Greek
ear it would no doubt speak of the general luxuriance and effeminacy of
the Persian manners. To put such an allusion into the mouth of Xerxes on
the present occasion is no doubt in the worst possible taste; but the
Greeks were too intensely national in their feelings to take a curious
account of such matters.

As in the conclusion of the Agamemnon, when the passion of the interested
parties has wrought itself up to a climax. So in the passionate dialogue
between Eteocles and Polynices, in Eurip. Phœnis. 591. The use of the
Trochees in these passages is thus precisely the same as that of the
Anapæsts in the finale of the <span class="sc">Prometheus</span>. In the <span class="sc">Persians</span>, they serve
to give an increased dignity to the person of Atossa, and the Shade of the

See Aristides and the musical writers; also Dionysius. Consider, also,
what a solemnity Plutarch attributes to the ἐμβατηριος παιων of the
Spartans (Lycurg. 22), which, of course, was either Dactylic or Anapæstic
verse. Altogether, there can be no greater mistake than to imagine that
our Dactylic and Anapæstic verse are the æsthetical equivalents of the
ancient measures from which their names are borrowed. They are, in many
parts of my translation, rather the equivalent of Dochmiac verse; and
this, in obedience to the uniform practice of our highest poets, in
passages of high passion and excitement.

made it the representative of the Anapæsts.

On the Dochmiacs, Ionic a minori, and other rhythmical details, the

fully stated in <i>Classical Museum</i>, No. III. p. 338; No. XIII. p. 319,
and No. XXII. p. 432. The Dochmiac verse was, in fact, equivalent to
a bar of 9/8 in modern music.&mdash;See <i>Apel&rsquo;s Metrik</i>.

The corrupt state of the Æschylean text is no doubt to be attributed
mainly to the rhetorical taste which, in the ages of the decadence,
prevailed so long at Rome, Athens, Alexandria, and Byzantium, and which
naturally directed the attention of transcribers to the text of
Euripides, the great master of tongue-fence and the model-poet of the
schools.&mdash;See <span class="sc">Quinctil</span>. X. 1.

There is a prevalent idea that the modern Greek language, or Romaic, as
it is called, is a different language from the ancient Greek, pretty much
in the same way that Italian is different from Latin. But this is a gross
mistake. Greek was and is one unbroken living language, and ought to be
taught as such.

The number fifty is mentioned in the Epigram of <span class="sc">Simonides</span>, beginning
ἠρχεν Αδείμαντος, in the above-mentioned prologue of <span class="sc">Tzetzes</span>, and in
<span class="sc">Pollux</span>, Lib. iv., 15, who says that this number of the Chorus was used
even by Æschylus up to the time when the Eumenides was represented. The
number <i>twelve</i> is commonly mentioned by other authorities as having
been used by Æschylus, while Sophocles is said to have increased it to
fifteen, which afterwards became the standard number. Müller
(Eumenides) ingeniously supposes that the tragic poets, so long as the
exhibition by tetralogies lasted, got the original number of <i>fifty</i>
from the public authorities, and divided it among the different pieces
of the tetralogy. Blomfield&rsquo;s notion (Preface to the <span class="sc">Persae</span>) that the
Chorus to the Eumenides consisted of only three persons, though a kind
word has been said in its favour lately (<span class="sc">Mason</span> in Smith&rsquo;s Dict. of
Antiq. <i>voce</i> <span class="sc">Chorus</span>), deserves, in my opinion, not a moment&rsquo;s
consideration, either on philological or æsthetical grounds. I may
mention here further, for the sake of those to whom these matters are
strange, that the Chorus holds communication with the other characters
in a Greek play generally by means of its Coryphaeus or Leader, which is
the reason why it is often addressed in the singular and not in the
plural number.

appears on the stage in some parts of the Orestean trilogy, this is to
be accounted for by the supposition that, in his later plays, the poet
adopted the improvements which his young rival had first introduced. The
number of actors here spoken of does not, of course, take into account
mutes or supernumeraries, such as we find in great numbers in the
Eumenides, and more or less almost in every extant piece of Æschylus.

The position of the old Theban senators, who form the Chorus in this
play, has called forth not a little learned gladiatorship lately;
<span class="sc">Böckh</span> (whose opinion on all such matters is entitled to the
profoundest respect) maintaining that the Chorus is the impersonated
wisdom of the play as conceived in the poet&rsquo;s mind, while some of his
critics (<i>Dyer</i> in <i>Class. Mus.</i> Vol. II. p. 69) represent them as a
pack of cowardly sneaking Thebans, whom it was the express object of the
poet to make ridiculous. This latter opinion is no more tenable than it
would be to say that it was the object of Æschylus to make his Chorus
of old men in that noted scene of the Agamemnon ridiculous; but so much
truth there certainly is in it, that from the inherent defect of
structure in the Greek tragedy, consisting in the constant presence of
the Chorus in the double capacity of impartial moralizers and actors
after a sort, there could not but arise this awkwardness to the poet
that, while he always contrived to make them speak wisely, he sometimes
could not prevent them from acting weakly, and even contemptibly.

From the limited number of actors arose necessarily this evil, that the
persons in a Greek dramatic fable appear not cotemporaneously, but in
succession, one actor necessarily playing several parts. Now, the
commonest fabricator of a novel for the circulating library knows how
necessary it is to keep up a sustained interest, that the character, when
once introduced, shall not be allowed to drop out of view, but be
dexterously intermingled with the whole complex progress of the story,
and be felt as necessary, or at least as agreeable, to the very end.

Writers on Belles Lettres, from <span class="sc">Trapp</span> down to <span class="sc">Schlegel</span>, have been
very severe on the modern opera, and indignantly repudiated all
comparison between it and the Greek tragedy. It is a common illusion of
mental optics with the learned to magnify the defects of what is near
and before their nose, while the peculiar excellencies of what is far
distant in time or space are in a corresponding degree exalted. So
<span class="sc">Schlegel</span>, in his sublime German zeal against certain shallow judgments
of Voltaire and other French critics, worked himself up into an
idealized enthusiasm for some of the most glaring imperfections of the
Greek stage, while in the modern opera he only sees the absurdities of
the real. In assuming this tone he has, of course, been imitated by
certain persons of little speculation in this country, who have thought
it necessary slavishly to worship the Germans in all things, merely
because certain other persons of no speculation ignorantly despised
them. With regard to the opera, it is plain enough that it differs from
the ancient tragedy in the following points:&mdash;(1) In not being
essentially of a religious character; (2) in not varying the musical
with the declamatory element; (3) in dealing more in monody, and less in
choral singing; (4) in using the Chorus freely, according to the nature
of the action, and not being always encumbered with it; (5) in making
the mere musical element so predominate that poets of the first order
seldom condescend to employ their talents in writing the text for an
opera. All these special differences, however, do not mar the propriety
of the general comparison between an ancient &ldquo;goat-song&rdquo; and a modern
opera, justified, as it is, plainly by the common musical element which
both contain in different degrees of prominence. In point of high moral
tone, high poetic diction, and noble conception, the ancient lyrical
drama is no doubt vastly superior to the modern opera; but in some other
points, as in the more free and adroit use of the Chorus, the opera is
as much superior to the goat-song. With respect to the <span class="sc">Chorus</span> in
particular, <span class="sc">Schlegel</span> has said many things that look very wise, but are
simply not true. The Chorus is only half described (see above, <a href="#pg020">p. 20</a>),
when it is called the &ldquo;ideal spectator.&rdquo; What he says about <i>publicity</i>
is mere talk. There is no other reason for the presence of the Chorus
than because it was originally the essential part of the performance,
and could not but be to the end the most popular.

From the διδασκαλία, or note of the year of representation with the
name of the author, in the argument to that play. On the arguments from
internal evidence brought forward to prove that the <span class="sc">Suppliants</span> is the
oldest extant play, I place no value whatever. The simplicity of
structure proves nothing, because it proves too much. Several of the
extant plays are equally simple. For aught we know, it may have been the
practice of Æschylus to the very last, as we see in the case of the
Choephoræ, to give the middle piece of his trilogies less breadth and
variety than the opening and concluding ones; and it is almost certain
that the <span class="sc">Suppliants</span> was either the second or the first play of a
trilogy.

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
